            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Our deſign in Publiſhing theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, is not to make old fores bleed, or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any ones diſcontent concerning the laying aſide of theſe Reverend and Godly

            <p>Much might be ſaid, as to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of theſe following Sermons: but wee forbear, they are of age let them ſpeak for themſelves, but thus much we are bold to ſay; Here lurks no Snake under theſe Herbs, no poyſonous Serpent, under theſe fragrant Flowers, no root of errour, no ſlip of Schiſme, no fruit of diſobedience, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome men may prejudge, concerning them; Theſe Sermons do breathe forth the holineſs and plainneſs of the Preachers ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who were very laborious and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the work of the Miniſtry, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be not ſo Notional and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical as many may deſire, yet they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially profitable and fitted to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of their Auditors, indeed they may well be ſtiled the Spiritual mans directory to the Caeleſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> the names and
<pb facs="tcp:109191:3"/>memories of the judicious and learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe Sermons are ſo precious to us for their great worths and eminent abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that we cannot but rejoyce at the publication of theſe their labours, that are ſo proper and genuine, and that theſe are ſuch, we are confidently aſſured. If thou queſtion the truth of this, come and ſee, do but peruſe them, their features will ſhew who was their Father, <hi>ſic oculos, ſic ille manus, ſic ora ferebat.</hi> If thou ſeriouſly peruſe them, thou ſhalt find much cauſe to encreaſe thy tears in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thoſe faithful Labourers that ſin hath deprived <hi>England</hi> of.

               <hi>Man,</hi> and concerning his <hi>Offices,</hi> eſpecially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>Prieſtly;</hi> and concerning the bleſſings and benefits, eſpecially in the matter of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> doth in this laſt <hi>Chapter,</hi> inſiſt on matters <hi>Hortatory;</hi> and, in the <hi>words,</hi> draws near to a concluſion, which contains a <hi>Prayer,</hi> wiſh, or deſire, which he puts up unto God, in the behalf of them, in order to their good and benefit. <hi>Now the God of Peace that brought again,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which words, conſidered by themſelves, there are two things conſiderable.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) The <hi>matter</hi> of the Apoſtle's Prayer.</item>
               <item>(2) The <hi>grounds,</hi> which he doth inſinuate for Audience.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In the things he deſires, the <hi>Matter of the Prayer</hi> is laid down in the 21 <hi>v.</hi> and is ſummarily and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propounded in ſeveral expreſſions; yet nevertheleſs ſo as they have their Specialities belonging to them. In the beginning, he ſhews what he aims at, <hi>make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> &amp;c. In general, it refers to their Sanctification, that they might be throughly ſanctified, as to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and outward Converſation, as to thoſe things that belong to them, in the Habits of their Minds, and external Carriage.</p>
            <p>The grounds which the Apoſtle uſes, by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation for Audience, are contained in the words of the 30th <hi>verſe;</hi> wherein we have a very large Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Perſon prayed unto; <hi>The God of Peace that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. He deſcribes him under ſuch Notes, and Marks, as ſerve much for inlargement and inforcement, in the matter of his Prayer.</p>
            <p>But here a Queſtion may ariſe; Seeing <hi>Grace</hi> is the thing the Apoſtle principally deſires, and 'tis uſual with holy men, both under the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Therein, firſt, the Apoſtle ſeems to make uſe of that ſame liberty, which belongs to holy men.

            <p n="2">(2) By what meanes the great Shepherd comes to have this honour confer'd upon him, that he ſhould be raiſed from the dead? There was worth enough in his Perſon, but 'tis not altogether aſcribed to this; but <hi>(through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant) i. e.</hi> by, and in, the vertue and efficacy of it: he had dyed as a <hi>Priest,</hi> and his bloud was a bloud of ſacrifice, and it was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation of Souls; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt did dye for ſo noble an end as this, and in ſuch a manner, as that his death became a Sacrifice, and did <hi>ſeal</hi> the <hi>everlaſting Covenant,</hi> whereof Chriſt is the <hi>Mediator:</hi> therefore with conſideration of this bloud of Chriſt, and of the ends, uſes, and benefits of it: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is Chriſt is raiſed from the dead. In the 9th of <hi>Zach.</hi> the Reſurrection of Chriſt was propheſied of, but by vertue of his blood ſhed; ſo that Chriſt was more fit to be raiſed, who dyed for ſuch noble and honourable ends, as the glory of God, and ſalvation of his people, in the vertue o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that Covenant God had made, and in the vertue of the bloud of Chriſt ſhed for the ſealing of that Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now, what this <hi>Covenant</hi> is, is worthy to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, becauſe of its Epithets: Called here <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant:</hi> There was a Temporal Covenant God made with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that was ſealed and confirmed by the bloud of Bullocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt took not on him this Covenant, he did not bind men to ſtand by thoſe termes contained in that Covenant; for indeed, Chriſt came to make it voyd. There is an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> Covenant, and that is nothing elſe but thoſe terms of grace and favour, which are propoſed to us in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which amounts to this, Who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repents ſhall be ſaved: He that repents, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his ſin ſhall find mercy; and that he will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to all on theſe Conditions in all parts of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109191:8"/>World; for theſe termes God will not repent of. If men repent, they ſhall have the benefit of it, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes ſhall be ſaved. 'Tis called [Everlaſting] becauſe God will abide by it, both here and hereafter; the ſtates of all ſhall be determined, according to the termes of this Covenant. Now Chriſt ſhed his bloud to procure thoſe termes contained in that Covenant; for the caſe of poor ſinners was ſo miſerable, that they could never come to have all their ſins pardoned, and their Souls certainly ſaved, unleſs Chriſt had dyed and ſhed his bloud, and ſo to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, that it might be free for him to be merciful, where he would be merciful. The Covenant is founded in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, that bloud being the <hi>bloud</hi> of the <hi>Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Covenant:</hi> therefore the Apoſtle ſo magnifies it, of all the great and Goſpel-bleſſings that belong to the New Teſtament, to the Condition of a Child of God, there is not any one like unto this, <hi>The bloud of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant:</hi> they that come to this, and have the benefit of this they ſhall be ſurely juſtified, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſaved in the vertue of this Bloud. In the buſineſs of being ſaved by <hi>Faith,</hi> it contributes nothing more, but as 'tis an Inſtrument to bring us to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the benefit of this bloud: we are ſaved not by the vertue of <hi>our believing,</hi> but by the vertue of <hi>his bloud;</hi> ſo that, 'tis not ſo much the <hi>act,</hi> as the <hi>object</hi> of Faith, that ſaves. Chriſt roſe in the vertue of his blond, and all our Comforts and Hopes are founded in his bloud. The bloud of Chriſt was of ſo much value with God, as that he will raiſe him from the dead, and tis of ſo much vertue to us, that through it we ſhall have Juſtification, Sanctification, and Salvation. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo good and gracious a God to Jeſus Chriſt and his Church; hereupon the Apoſtle imboldens himſellf to deſire this further manifeſtation of his love, that where
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109191:9"/>he hath ſo bountifully provided for the juſtification of ſinners through the bloud of Chriſt, that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their ſanctification by his Spirit. Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) God is, with ſome ſingularity, <hi>the God of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) To the end that God might ſhew himſelf to be the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> he hath provided an alſufficient Saviour for his people, here called the <hi>Great Shepherd of the flock;</hi> and God being of agracious diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, provides to that end Chriſt ſhall take the care of them, and of all thoſe things that pertaine to their Eternall wellfare.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) It was expedient this Perſon ſhould <hi>dye,</hi> though the <hi>Great Shepherd;</hi> Nay it was <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that it might be ſo much more verified and manifeſted, that he was the Great Shepherd of the ſheep, that he ſhould lay down his life for the flock.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) It was, as neceſſary that Chriſt ſhoud be <hi>raiſed from the Dead,</hi> as that he ſhould dye. Therefore his Continuance was but a Temporary, nay, a Momentary time to him. Now Chriſt is riſen, yea, all power in Heaven and earth is committed to him; and if he was able to doe any thing for his people before, much more now.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) The Reſurrection of Chriſt doth ariſe partly from the Tenor of the Covenant God made with man, and partly from the virtue and benefit that was in the bloud of Chriſt. God put himſelfe into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Chriſt was mediator of it, and in vertue of that Covenant, ſinners muſt be ſaved; but the Saviour muſt firſt ſave himſelfe, raiſe himſelfe from the dead, and then hath all power committed to his hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are two things I would have you further obſerve and carry away.</p>

If Chriſt be the Great Shepherd, then the Church, muſt hear his voice, for <hi>my ſheep hear my voice, &amp;c.</hi> And if He be the Great Shepherd then the Church muſt be Ruled by him, for the Shepherd muſt have the ordering of the flock, and the flock muſt be at the diſpoſall of the Shepherd; and then Thirdly, The flock of Chriſt muſt be carefull to pleaſe him, (for fear he ſet his Dog upon them) that we provok him not to exerciſe his Correcting power. He hath his Rod of Diſcpline (as well as his Staffe and Crook) which is to be performed by others as ſeems good to him, for he hath many wayes to ler looſe the Devill on his owne Children. <hi>Satan</hi> had a deſire to afflict <hi>Job,</hi> and God gave way to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Church of God, is Gods <hi>Spouſe</hi> and there is a great deale of love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Husband and Wife, between Chriſt and the Church: Yet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.5. this ſhe is ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged with all.

In this reſpect, Chriſt will have all his members to be raiſed, in that he got the victory over death, for Chriſt aroſe as the <hi>Firſt fruits,</hi> and aſcended into Heaven as <hi>a fore-runner.</hi> Though we may have deniall as to the advancing of Chriſts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet the Reſurrection of the dead is that we muſt take into our thoughts, and, tis our ſolid comfort, God will one day bring all the ſheep together into one fold, and <hi>David</hi> ſhall be their King, and have the Ruling and ordering of them to all Eternity. There is a Reſurrection to little ſhepherds: when we come to lay down our naturall lives, we can look for no other recompence for it but our Reſurrection, and the thoughts of it muſt be our Comfort. And oh! how doth this incourage us to come unto God, though ſinne be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie upon us: Remember, there is <hi>a God of peace,</hi> that takes to himſelf this name for this very end, that ſinners may know, for their incouragment, that Reconciliation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109191:11"/>is wrought out between God and them through Jeſus Chriſt; and if they will but come and take hold of the bloud of the everlaſting Covenant, Chriſt hath ſaid they ſhall have all the bleſſings and benefits promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, and that the bloud of Chriſt can procure for them; they ſhall have forgivneſs of ſinnes, and ſalvation of Soul. Therefore, when we conſider Chriſt hath dyed to have a flock, and for ſaving of the flock, and to make himſelf the God of peace through his bloud, this ſhould comfort us.</p>
            <p>It remains, we come to conſider of the <hi>matter of the Prayer:</hi> this is very full. <hi>Make you perfect in every good work to doe his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight,</hi> &amp;c. Here we are to obſerve two things, Firſt The <hi>matter</hi> of the Apoſtle's deſire, Secondly, The <hi>meaſure</hi> of it. The <hi>matter of his deſire is,</hi> that the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> may be made <hi>perfect in every good work to doe the will of God,</hi> i. e. that they may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thoroughly regenerate, ſanctified throughout both in ſoul and body, and that they may be furniſhed with all graces, and inabled for every duty. Take notice of every one of the expreſſions: Firſt, Make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Tis the duty of Chriſtians to perfect every good work, to cleanſe themſelves from all the impurity of fleſh and ſpirit, and to perfect Holineſſe in the fear of the Lord, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) Secondly, In every good work, in matters of <hi>Piety, Righteouſneſſe, Charity, Sobriety;</hi> for within theſe head, moſt of thoſe things may be comprehended that belong to Chriſtians, they will goe a very great way to make a perfect, Chriſtian, but that Chriſtian cannot be perfect that is not ſanctified in every one of theſe. Thirdly, <hi>To doe his will;</hi> that you may be ready, chearfully willing, to do his will on all occaſions.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:109191:11"/>
            <p>But, how is it poſſible fleſh and bloud ſhould attain to this? that they ſhould be <hi>perfect to every good work?</hi> Why, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>working in you that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt. Working in you:</hi> You ſee thereby, All our works depend on God's, and 'tis in vain for us to build on any Foundation but this; for 'tis God that worketh in you, both to will, and to do, of his good pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c. Col.</hi> 2.12. through the Faith of the operation of God, <hi>working in you,</hi> or doing in you, or cauſing in you, or making in you, that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight. Our work is to depend on God's work; our outward working, depends on God's inward working.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>that which is acceptable in God's ſight;</hi> but 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Good works themſelves, though never ſo good, agreeable to the Law and Goſpel; yet if God look not on our perſons and works through Chriſt, they will not ſerve the turn, ye cannot be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted; <hi>working in you, that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Will God be pleaſed with nothing, but onely for Chriſt Jeſus his ſake? and if it do not pleaſe Chriſt, will it not pleaſe God? 'Tis tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, plainly, verily, ſo. That which God cannot accept of through Chriſt, he doth not accept of at all: But now things are ſo ordered, that God hath put all things into Chriſt's hands; Chriſt Jeſus hath the ordering of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> he hath the making of all the Articles of the Chriſtian's Creed; a Chriſtian is bound to believe nothing, but what Chriſt teaches, as neceſſary to Salvation: ſo that in Chriſt we are compleat, if we believe, as he teaches us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and if we worſhip God, as he teaches us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God; and have ſuch order and government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his houſe; and walk ſo, as we deſire in all things, to pleaſe our Lord and Maſter, and have him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109191:12"/>our eye, then are we returned unto Chriſt, the Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls. But, if we preſent God with any kind of Creed, Model of Worſhip, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Government, that hath not Chriſt's Image and Stamp upon it, God will ſay, as Chriſt, concerning the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; <hi>Whoſe Image or Superſcription doth it bear?</hi> If we can ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s; the way of Worſhip, we have learn'd from Chriſt, that Order and Government in the Church, we have learn'd from Chriſt, then the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> will own it. If it have <hi>Man's Superſcription</hi> on it, not God's, or Chriſt's, I cannot tell how we ſhould preſume it can be acceptable to God, through Chriſt; for God hath ſo confin'd himſelf, he will not be pleaſed, but through Chriſt; and that all <hi>Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ſhould be ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s mind; as the <hi>Old,</hi> according to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> 'This neceſſary, we enquire after Chriſt's mind, in what we do: If we can do any thing, and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, are ſure it will be acceptable to God, through Chriſt, well and good; otherwiſe, not. This is the Apoſtle's Prayer, <hi>That God would make them perfect in every good work to do his will, working in them that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doxology; Whether we refer it to God, or Chriſt, 'tis all one; we have no body to honour and glorifie in the Church, but God, through Chriſt: We cannot tell how to divide thoſe that are ſo nearly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Therefore, when we glorifie God, we glorifie Chriſt. And this we muſt obſerve; God hath ordered all man's Concernments ſo, that we have nothing to plead for our Souls Salvation, but God's Grace: the Rule is his Word, his Goſpel that he hath made known to us: and therefore, <hi>Let the Word of God dwell in you richly in all wiſdom.</hi> There is a great deal of <hi>Do,</hi> in God's Church, about This and That; he that muſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109191:12"/>the buſineſs, is Chriſt, and there are but two ways; the determining of things for the <hi>preſent,</hi> and for the <hi>time to come;</hi> hereafter, <hi>by queſtioning the matter of fact;</hi> for the preſent, <hi>by making of your Rule.</hi> When the queſtion comes, concerning the Matter of Fact, theſe he receives our Rule: What hath Chriſt ſaid? How hath Chriſt provided in things of this nature? It's plainly ſo, and ſo; but in dubious Matter, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and the like, I know not how to anſwer them, when we come to anſwer Chriſt, when he ſhall put the Queſtion; Did you not know whom you was bound to fear? Did I not ſpeak nothing at all in the Caſe, neither generally, not particularly? Could you not by any means come to underſtand my mind? I doubt we ſhall not be able to anſwer this. But we muſt ſay, we found a certain ſtate in the Word; but having Laws and Cuſtoms among our ſelves, therein were at a ſtand. Why (ſaith Chriſt) was <hi>your Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, or below, my Word? Muſt your <hi>Law</hi> be ruled by my <hi>Word;</hi> or my Word by your Doctrine? Did not all Chriſtians hold out this, that the Word of Chriſt was above all Authority in the Matters of Chriſt? Shall the Members of the Body become greater then the Head? Therefore, you could not be ignorant in this Caſe: your own profeſſing me to be ſo great, in all my <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Offices;</hi> but when you come to practice, then you will deny me. Shall we be able to anſwer this? We muſt conſider of this; that if we would pleaſe God, it muſt be through Chriſt; and then we muſt carry our ſelves, as directed by Chriſt Jeſus in his Word; and nothing can take us off that Principle, no pretence whatſoever; for <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is ſuch a thing in the nature and ſubſtance of it, as Jeſus Chriſt is the Author of.

               <p>(1) He is alone able to allow and diſpenſe this peace to us; for, all our ſins are injuries committed againſt him, againſt his Crown and Dignity; all the Arreſts of Conſcience are made in the name of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is only He that can ſpeak peace. As in the <hi>Civil State,</hi> it is an Act of Supremacy to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; only he that can condemn is able to ſpeak a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; ſo, it is that God that is our Judge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and incenſed by us, he that hath a judiciall power to caſt body and ſoule into hell-fire, is alone able to ſpeak peace, and paſſe a Pardon for us in the Court of Heaven: and this is experienced by a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſpirit; it is juſt with ſuch a perſon as it is with a <hi>Malefactor,</hi> who ſtands condemned at the Bar; he cannot receive encouragement from any of his Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors till the <hi>Judge</hi> ſpeak peace to him: So, if an Angell from Heaven ſhould come and ſpeak to a wounded Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. It were impoſſible, unleſſe God did order, command and diſpenſe it, that the Spirit ſhould receive any peace, becauſe our ſins are immediatly committed againſt him.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) He is alone able to reveal and diſcover it. There is nothing harder in the world, than to calm and quiet a diſturbed conſcience; it muſt be the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that makes light to ſpring out of darkneſſe, that muſt cauſe a cheerfull ſerenity in a dark and diſconſolate ſoul.

So, <hi>Job If he hide his face, who is able to be at peace?</hi> There needs no other fury to compleat the miſery of a man, than his own accuſing conſcience. Conſcience is a verier <hi>devil</hi> than the devill himſelf, and able more to torment and laſh the creature. Therefore if that be once awakened, 'tis only God, to whoſe tribunal conſcience is liable, which is able to ſpeak peace to the ſoul. Now you ſee in what reſpect this Title, <hi>[The God of peace]</hi> is attributed to him, as he is the <hi>Author</hi> and worker of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As he loves and delights in peace. This is that which is ſo pleaſing to him, that he adopts thoſe into the line of Heaven, who are <hi>Peace-makers, for they ſhall,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109191:16"/>be called the Children of God,</hi> Matth. 5.6. This characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes perſons to be his children, to be ally'd to him. God he only delights in reflection of <hi>his own Image;</hi> for thoſe things that we admire in the world, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, do not affect his heart: <hi>He delights not in the ſtrength of the horſe; he taketh not pleaſure in the legs of a man. The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that feare him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy.</hi> Nothing attracts his eye and heart, but his own <hi>ſimilitude</hi> and <hi>reſemblance;</hi> and therefore, where he ſees <hi>peaceable diſpoſitions,</hi> this is that which indeers the ſoul to him, and makes it ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his eyes. You may judge of his <hi>delight</hi> in peace by this it is that grace, which in an eſpeciall manner prepares us for communion with him; for, we can never really honour nor enjoy him, unleſſe we bring to him thoſe diſpoſitions, which (if I may ſo ſpeak) are in himſelfe. And therefore it is no wonder, that thoſe have little <hi>peace of conſcience,</hi> who make ſo litle <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of peace.</hi> You know, when God appeared to <hi>Eliah,</hi> he did not appear in the <hi>Storm,</hi> nor in the <hi>Fire,</hi> but in the <hi>ſmall ſtill voice,</hi> and when <hi>Eliſha</hi> was tranſported with <hi>anger,</hi> he was fain to allay that paſſion by Muſick, that ſo he might be prepared for the holy motions of the Spirit; he call'd for an inſtrument, and then the Spirit moved in him. I bring it for this end, to ſhew, how God <hi>delights in peace,</hi> and he will only maintain commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with thoſe that are of calm and peaceable ſpirits.

As <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid, <hi>What Peace, ſo long as the Whoredoms of thy Mother</hi> Jezebel, <hi>and her Witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> So, What Peace can there be, ſo long as thou doſt indulge thy ſelf in ſin, and make it thy buſineſs, to gratifie thy outward ſenſes, though it be to the diſpleaſure of God? 'Tis the greateſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the World, to rob ſuch perſons of their Peace, and to diſcover to them their danger; they are onely capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of true peace, by the knowledge of that which is falſe. Therefore, bring your ſelves to this Tryal, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or no, doth that peace, which now you pleaſe your ſelves in, cauſe in you an eternal hatred of ſin? Doth it ſet you at a diſtance from your moſt beloved Luſts? Then it is that Peace that ſprings from God. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the World are in a ſtate of <hi>War</hi> with God, though they do not feel the effects of that <hi>War.</hi> True indeed, God doth not always draw the Sword, either of Famine, Peſtilence, or War, againſt a Nation; and yet they may be acting in a moſt hoſtile way againſt <hi>God:</hi> So, for a perſon; God may not blaſt thy eſtate, or ſend Diſeaſes upon thy perſon, or raiſe a Tumult in thy Conſcience, and make a Conſpiracy of thy Thoughts and Paſſions againſt thy Peace: Thou mayſt be quiet

Or rather, there is not a Truce between God &amp; ſinner; but, as a Town that is beſieged for many days, may not feel the Battery of their Enemy, becauſe he is undermining them, to blow them up at once; ſo God doth not many times make his Battery againſt ſinners, but he is undermining them; and the Fall, at the laſt, will be dreadful, if there be not a compoſition.</p>

Firſt, he gives you here the Title of <hi>the God of Peace;</hi> and then he ſaith, <hi>[Himſelf] The God of Peace himſelf.</hi> There's a great deal of force in that word; Peace is ſo excellent a bleſſing, and there is ſuch an abhorrency in our corrupt nature to it, that it is onely the <hi>Lord himſelf</hi> that is able to effect it: As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, The Lord muſt bow the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, he muſt come down <hi>himſelf</hi> to create Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you; and, to expreſs the greater vehemency of his deſire, he ſaith, <hi>Give you peace always, by all means.</hi> So another Scripture, Purſue Peace, <hi>Follow Peace with all men;</hi> a word, that imports our <hi>purſuit</hi> after it, though it <hi>run</hi> from us. This is the ſtrain and tenour of the Goſpel, and this becomes you as Chriſtians. When Chriſt came to purchaſe our Peace, he came as a Lamb, an innocent and meek Creature, <hi>Behold the Lamb
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109191:20"/>of God.</hi> When the Holy Spirit deſcended, to ſeal the priviledge of Peace to us, he deſcended in the form of a Dove; a gaul-leſs Creature, in whom there is no rancour nor bitterneſs. What a ſtrong engagement ſhould this be upon all of us, to purſue and promote Peace? And for your encouragement, conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That in the times of the Goſpel, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, do, as it were, empty themſelves into this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the bleſſing of Peace.

For here the Scripture inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in thoſe Creatures, between which there is the moſt natural, and therefore the moſt fierce Animoſities. The Lord will reconcile men, though their differences he never ſo great. What is too hard for the God of Peace to effect? Is not God of infinite power, of infinite love? then it ſhould quicken us to purſue Peace.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) By Prayer to him, becauſe he is able to effect it: Certainly, that God that was able to bring Order into the World, when it was a meer lump and maſs of Confuſion, is able to bring peace, and to unite our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And it is obſervable, the greater our differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and diviſions are, the more will the power of the

To give you ſome Inſtances, that ſo we may encourage our Faith, and quicken our Prayer to God for this bleſſing.

Firſt, <hi>David</hi> was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with Troubles, and then his head was deck'd with the Imperial Crown. So if you look into the Kingdom of Chriſt, who would have thought that a few <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> ſhould have advanced the Empire of Chriſt in the World: had you lived to have ſeen thoſe deſpicable beginnings, when a few unlearned men were the Heraulds and Preachers of Chriſt, how would this have cauſed you to fail and ſink in your Spirits? and yet the Goſpel hath been preached in all the parts of the World, and that by a few <hi>Fiſhermen.</hi> The Providences of God, are like thoſe plated Pictures, if you look one way upon them, there is the appearance of a Serpent; if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109191:21"/>you look on the other ſide, there's the appearance of an Angel. So here, many times God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuffer exaſperations to go very high, that ſo his power may appear more eminent in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of them. He it is that enables the Faith of his people, to draw Water out of the Rock, when the Fountain is dry: that makes meat to come out of the Eater, (as in <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Riddle) that is able to bring a peaceable harmony, out of devouring differences: and therefore it ſhould quicken our Prayers to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To make us more ſerious in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after peace. Conſider, what a diſhonour it is to the Goſpel; that thoſe that profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Sons of the ſame God, Members of the ſame Chriſt, Temples of the ſame Spirit, ſhould be at deadly jars one with another. It is ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, that Lillies ſhould prove Thorns to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: that thoſe who are <hi>Saints in pretence,</hi> ſhould be Devils in practice to one another: that God's Diamonds ſhould cut one another; this is very ſtrange, yet thus it is. But how eſpecially, it is moſt ſad, when <hi>Religion,</hi> which ſhould reſtrain and bridle our Paſſions, is made fewel and inſentives of them: How for diſtant is it from the counſel of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. where he ſpeaks concerning their leſſer differences, <hi>One values one day above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, another eſteems every day alike;</hi> what's his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel? He ſpeaks as a perſon that was fill'd with bowels and compaſſion: Oh, ſaith he, let not him that doth not eſteem the day, judge him that doth; <hi>For we ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt;</hi> there we ſhall appear all upon a Level,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109191:21"/>ſtand upon equal ground, and receive our final doom from him: This therefore ſhould calm our Spirits. Why may there not be ſome differences in <hi>Judgment,</hi> without diviſion in <hi>Affection;</hi> for it is as impoſſible, that all Judgments ſhould be of the ſame extent, as all our faces to be of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and figure. Therefore conſider, what an injury it is to our Profeſſion, how doth it obſcure the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and luſtre of our Religion?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Doth not the <hi>publick Enemy</hi> rejoyce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, I mean the <hi>Papiſts?</hi> Do they not warm themſelves at the ſparks of our Diviſions? for you know the old Maxim of <hi>Divide and Reign:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould compoſe our ſpirits, and quicken us to labour after Union. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmortifi'd Luſts</hi> are thence, whence all Wars &amp; Enmities ſprings in the World. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he would compoſe their differences, he doth not lay down Rules to decide their Controverſies, but corrects their ſecret Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Pride, Self-ſeeking, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this being the Seed of all Diſturbances in the Church: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe Luſts may not be conſpicuous and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the eyes of men, yet they are certainly the Fuel of our Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of all is this; Thoſe that have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, they cannot but mourn, and be ſenſible of theſe Diviſions. I know, a great part among us are unconcern'd: ſome rejoyce, thoſe that are rather buried in the Affairs of the World, and incumbred with much buſineſs, or thoſe that are ſteeped in the pleaſures of ſenſe, are altogether unaffected with theſe things, and ſtand as <hi>Neuters,</hi> diſ-regarding all events: But the Saints of God cannot but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109191:22"/>mourn over them, when our Diviſions hinder the progreſs of the Goſpel, and are ſerviceable to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to the Kingdom of Darkneſs. Therefore, I beſeech you, let what hath been ſpoken, quicken you in your Prayers to God, to <hi>pray for the peace of Jeruſalem,</hi> (that's the leaſt effect of our love and deſires after Peace) and by all endeavours, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring back Peace to us, that we may ſee that <hi>Propheſie</hi> fulfilled in our time, that <hi>the Lord ſhall be one, and his Name one amongſt us.</hi>

               <p>THe Apoſtle deſcribes God by the <hi>effects of his power and love, [That brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus.]</hi> The Reſurrection of Chriſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109191:23"/>from the dead, is one of the moſt tranſcendent te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of God's <hi>love</hi> and <hi>power</hi> towards us.</p>
               <p>(1) Of his Love; becauſe as the <hi>Anger</hi> of God was that which crucified our Saviour, ſo on the contrary, it muſt be his <hi>Love</hi> that ſhould raiſe and reſtore him. Chriſt when he died, he looked upon God as an Enemy, as a Judge, and as thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which we ſee conveyed to us, are unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the <hi>Medium,</hi> through which we ſee them; as, if we look through a coloured Gloſs, we ſee the object of that colour: So the Lord Jeſus, when he was upon the Croſs, looked upon God through the black cloud of our ſins, and through the red cloud of his Father's wrath, and ſo died as a ſacrifice to Divine Juſtice. But when he was raiſed from the Grave, that was the reſtimony of God's love to him, and of his love to us; for he died as our <hi>Surety,</hi> he was <hi>arreſted</hi> for our <hi>debt,</hi> he was caſt into the <hi>Grave</hi> as into a <hi>Priſon:</hi> But by his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> he was redeemed from Priſon and Judgment. And therefore you ſhall find, when Chriſt was riſen, he ſalutes his Diſciples with this, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> (<hi>Luk</hi> 24.31.) There was the dawning of peace at the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Chriſt, for then the Angels ſung, <hi>Peace upon Earth;</hi> but the compleat Sun-ſhine of peace was at his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> when he had made full and compleat ſatisfaction to God's Juſtice; for this was a clearing of him before all the World, when God rais'd him from the grave. And in this reſpect, it was very agreeable for the Apoſtle to ſay, <hi>The God of Peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:109191:23"/>
               <p>(2) It was the effect of <hi>Infinite Power.</hi> You know, 'tis naturally impoſſible for a dead body to quicken it ſelf, to revive; but for the Lord Jeſus, who had the load of the ſins of all the Elect upon him, who was, as it were, ſecured in the grave by God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Power, for him to riſe again: This muſt be an effect of <hi>Infinite Power</hi> in the great God. This raiſing of Chriſt, ſometimes 'tis attributed to the <hi>Son,</hi> being <hi>God</hi> equal with the Father; but here 'tis attributed to <hi>God:</hi> And therefore, when the Scripture would ſpeak with the greateſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the <hi>Power of God,</hi> it expreſſes it thus, <hi>That Power which raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> When Chriſt wrought deliverance for the loſt world, (all thoſe who were committed to his charge.) This could be no leſs than the work of an Infinite Power. And upon this account alſo, it is very proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the deſign of the Apoſtle; for that Prayer he makes to God is for that, which onely can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by <hi>Infinite Love,</hi> and <hi>infinite Power, i.e.</hi> to make the Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews perfect in every good work to do his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come to a further deſcription. <hi>He that brought again from the dead [our Lord Jeſus.]</hi> The Title of the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> was only given to our Saviour after his Reſurrection; he was called <hi>Lord</hi> before, and <hi>Jeſus</hi> before; but theſe two Titles were never u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited till after his Reſurrection; <hi>They came to ſee the place where the Body of the Lord Jeſus lay;</hi> the reaſon was this, Becauſe the Reſurrection of Chriſt was a ſolemn Proclamation to the world, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>Son of God;</hi> 'tis true, this Title was iven him immediately upon the Conception, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109191:24"/>it was never compleatly declared to the world, till after his Reſurrection; for before, Chriſt was a <hi>Prince in diſguiſe,</hi> the beams of his <hi>Divinity</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by the vail of his <hi>Humanity;</hi> but then he was declared by power to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>It follows. <hi>[That great Shepherd of the Sheep.]</hi> For the opening of this,
<list>
                     <item>(1) We will conſider this Title of Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>(2) The perſon for whom this Title re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, This Title, <hi>[The great Shepheard.]</hi> 'Tis a wonderful condeſcention in Chriſt, that he will take upon him the Title of a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> that which rather expreſſes <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> than <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion;</hi> yet he is pleaſed to aſſume this Title to expreſs his affection to us. For the opening of it, wherein he appears to be the <hi>great Shepheard,</hi> I ſhall lay down theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) He is <hi>great</hi> in the <hi>Dignity of his Perſon;</hi> for he that is Lord of Angels, is become the <hi>Shepheard of the ſheep;</hi> and the <hi>humiliation of his Perſon</hi> in this reſpect, is the <hi>exaltation of his Office:</hi> It is looked upon in the World, as a mean and low employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have the care and inſpection of a Flock; but now herein appears the love of Chriſt, he was pleaſed to become our <hi>Shepheard,</hi> that ſo he might ſecure and bring us to the Fold of Heaven, and there make us to feed upon thoſe Paſtures, and to drink of thoſe Rivers of pleaſure which flow from the preſence of God.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) In the <hi>derivation of his Authority;</hi> that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is communicated to him, whereby he is our Shepheard, and that is originally from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109191:24"/>God himſelf; it is not by any mediate deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but from God himſelf. He is our Shepheard, and hath a Title to his Flock upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: (1) They are committed to him as his <hi>Charge</hi> and cuſtody, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) All the Elect of the World were given by God the Father to Chriſt, not by way of <hi>Alienation,</hi> but by way of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigneration,</hi> as ſo many pledges which he was to bring to grace and glory; and this Charge he doth moſt fully execute, for there is none miſſing of thoſe committed to him. (2) They are given to him by way of <hi>Reward</hi> and Recompence, for all his Blood and Sufferings, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10.) The Lord Jeſus put ſuch a value on ſouls, that he purchaſed an Intereſt in them by his own Blood; and he thinks himſelf exceedingly recompenced for all his Pains on the Croſs, Agonies in the Garden, Temptations in the Wilderneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if Souls will ſubmit to his care. And here obſerve the courſe of Heaven, God would endear Souls to Chriſt upon all reaſons, by vertue of his command, and that charge he gives to them, and by vertue of his own purchaſe.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) If you conſider the <hi>extent</hi> of his <hi>care</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> for all the Saints of the world, thoſe who are diſperſed in all places, in all Ages, they are all his Flock; and therefore 'tis the Royalty of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16.) <hi>There ſhall be one Fold, and one Shepheard.</hi> As Chriſt is the onely <hi>Catholick King,</hi> ſo he is the only <hi>Univerſal Biſhop;</hi> for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shepheards have but particular portions of his Flock committed to their charge; and they ſhould be ſuch portions as they have <hi>regard to,</hi> and <hi>are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their inſpection.</hi> And at the laſt day, all his ſheep
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109191:25"/>ſhall congregate together, and ſtand at his right hand. All the Saints of God that are now ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſo many Stars in the Firmament, ſhall be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in one Conſtellation, when they ſhall appear in glory before him.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) In reſpect of his endowments and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which fit him for the diſcharge of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Take notice of his affection and love to us, and that is the wonder of Heaven and Earth, <hi>Chriſt laid down his life for his ſheep,</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 10, 11.) This is ſtrange, that Chriſt ſhould be a <hi>ſheep for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that he might become our Shepheard; that he ſhould be a Sacrifice, before he could take this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon him: Other Sheep lay down their lives for the Shephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rd, but Chriſt laid down his life for the Sheep. So great was his love, that it brought him from Heaven to <hi>ſeek and find thoſe that were loſt;</hi> he left a <hi>Palace</hi> to come to a <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> a Throne of Heaven, to come to a Fold here upon Earth. We read of <hi>David,</hi> that he exchanged a <hi>Sheep-hook</hi> for a <hi>Scepter;</hi> but Chriſt quite contrary, he chang'd a <hi>Scepter</hi> for the <hi>Rod and Staffe of a Shepheard.</hi> It was ſaid by one, There is nothing ſo conſpicuous in Chriſt, as the <hi>prodigality of his love</hi> to us. Oh! do but conſider <hi>how great love</hi> that was, that ſhould make him to die for us, that he might bring us home to his Fold. We were all of us like <hi>erring Sheep,</hi> who had ſtrayed from him, and fell to the <hi>Lord of the ſoil,</hi> as ſtrange Cattel: we were gotten into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>the god of this World;</hi> the Lord Chriſt would buy us off from thence: though we forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our <hi>right in him,</hi> yet he would not loſe <hi>his right
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109191:25"/>in us;</hi> but he laid down his life, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to his Fold; that of <hi>Wolves,</hi> he might make us <hi>Lambs,</hi> and fit us for the comforts of his preſence.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) In reſpect of his <hi>exact dil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no perſon, be he never ſo mean, never ſo obſcure, though loſt in the number and account of the world, if he be one of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſheep, he is always under his inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and watchfulneſs. We read of the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> that he carried the names of the <hi>Tribes</hi> upon his <hi>Breaſt-plate,</hi> the Lord Chriſt carries the names of all his ſheep in his <hi>Heart;</hi> therefore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. ſpeaking concerning the Saints, all that dwel upon earth, <hi>whoſe names are writ in the Book of Life.</hi> His diligence and care is ſo exact, that he hath all their names writ in his Book: He th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t tells the Stars, counts their hairs, and always exerciſes the moſt watchful providence over them for good. You know ſheep are either ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>rage,</hi> or <hi>erring</hi> and <hi>wandring:</hi> Chriſt's dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is ſuch, that he protects them from the rage of Satan, reduces them from all their wandring, and brings them home to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) In making proportionable all their ſervices and ſufferings to thoſe degrees of ſtrength which he gives to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a ſhepherd, he ſhall gather the lambs with his arms, and carry them in his boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> Chriſt always makes a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109191:26"/>the ſervices, ſufferings and ſtrength he calls them to. He it is that with that tenderneſs ſpeaks to <hi>Peter, Peter loveſt thou me? feed my Lambs.</hi> He hath provided for them the moſt ample and moſt ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nouriſhment, the Ordinances of the Goſpel, the Word, the Promiſes, which are the Breaſts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; theſe are all provided by him for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And in this reſpect he is the great Shepherd, for he doth not only allow them means, but bleſſes the means to them: he is able to enlighten the <hi>dark mind,</hi> and he can make pliable the ſtubborn will, &amp; he can ſpirituallize droſſie affections, which all other ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds in the world are not able to effect.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) He is the great Shepheard, if you conſider his <hi>power to preſerve them from danger;</hi> not only thoſe dangers which reſpect Satan, (for that fell under his care before) but thoſe diſeaſes to which they are liable, which threaten ruine: Other Shepheards poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may cure diſeaſes, but not defend them from danger. Chriſt it is tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>gives eternal life to his ſheep,</hi> he begins the <hi>life of holineſs,</hi> which though at preſent is but as a ſpark in the Sea, yet he keeps it alive till it ſhall break forth into a triumphant flame. That <hi>life</hi> that is encompaſſed with ſo many enemies, and liable to ſo many weakneſſes, the Lord Jeſus will <hi>bring forth judgment to victory,</hi> and will make them to be powerful over ſpiritual and eternal enemies.</p>
               <p>The ſum is this: The Lord Chriſt is ſo perfect a Shepheard, ſo compleat, as to all the qualifications of that office, that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> breaks forth into exaltation, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.) <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd, &amp;c.</hi> and then afterwards expreſſes all thoſe proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are made for him by God as a Shepheard,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109191:26"/>
                  <hi>He makes me to lie down in green Pastures, he leadeth me beſide the ſtill waters.</hi> So that you ſee, Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for diligence, love, tenderneſs, for preſerving us from danger, for ſecuring us to life eternal, he is only the <hi>great Shepheard;</hi> he is the God of ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, as well as the God of ſheep, and all other ſhepheards are but inferior to him, and muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to him for the ſouls of his ſheep, which are more valuable than all the world.</p>
               <p>It follows, <hi>The great Shepheard [of the ſheep.]</hi> I ſhall not ſpend any time in making any reſemblance between the people of God and ths ſheep: only,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) They are ſheep in reſpect of their <hi>Innocency.</hi> You know of all creatures, the ſheep are unarmed; other creatures, either they are armed with ſtrength, or skin, or ſwiftneſs, to guard themſelves, and offend others; but the ſheep hath neither the ſtrength of the <hi>Lion,</hi> the craft of the <hi>Fox,</hi> ſwiftneſs of the <hi>Deer,</hi> and of all creatures is moſt weak, inoffenſive, and moſt liable to dangers and injuries. Of all perſons, Gods people are moſt liable to danger, and when out of <hi>Chriſts protection,</hi> the weakeſt perſons in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) In reſpect of their <hi>Meekneſs.</hi> A ſheep is an <hi>emblem of meekneſs,</hi> that's their temper, and therein they imitate Chriſt, who hath propounded himſelf to be their pattern, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly;</hi> both theſe qualities are expreſt by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.) where ſpeaking concerning the times of the Goſpel, ſaith, <hi>The Lamb ſhall lie down with the Wolf:</hi> now, where the <hi>Prophet</hi> expreſſes their <hi>ſafety,</hi> there he expreſſes their <hi>innocency</hi> &amp; <hi>meekneſs.</hi> This is the reaſon why the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>For thy ſake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109191:27"/>ſheep for the ſlaughter:</hi> becauſe of all Creatures, moſt liable to injuries, that which doth leaſt reſent them. And, where ever the Grace of Chriſt comes, it ſweetens the moſt cruel nature, and poliſhes the moſt rough diſpoſition, and makes them to be like <hi>Chriſt, meek and lowly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) In regard of their <hi>profitableneſs;</hi> for of all Creatures, they are moſt profitable; the food, as to their fleſh; the cloth, as to their fleece. And the people of God, however they are expoſed to the contempts and injuries of the World, they are the moſt <hi>profitable;</hi> for, were it not for them, the whole frame of Nature would fall into pieces, the Stars would fall like leaves in Autumn, and all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would fall into confuſion: we ſee it by one <hi>Lot,</hi> who kept ſhowers of fire and brimſtone from falling on <hi>Sodom,</hi> till he was got out of it. And it is the people of God, for whom this frame of Nature is continued; and when they are brought into the Fold of Chriſt, the Juſtice of God will have a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn triumph over all the World.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) As they are liable to <hi>wandring:</hi> Sheep are wandring Creatures, and when ſtrayed, not able to reduce themſelves. And, in this reſpect, the people of God are ſheep, they have a thouſand allurements to draw them from the ways of God; and if God ſhould not guide them by his eye, 'tis impoſſible they ſhould go in the way that leads to Heaven. Therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have gone aſtray like a loſt ſheep, ſeek thy ſervant, Pſal.</hi> 119.176.

               <p>The ſecond Argument is this, That he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd Chriſt to be the Shepherd of the Church, <hi>The great Shepherd of the ſheep;</hi> this is another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Evidence, that he is reconciled to us, and that he is the <hi>God of Peace:</hi> For when God gave Chriſt to be our Sacrifice, and raiſed him up to be our Shepherd, theſe are the moſt clear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his love: For, although Chriſt now ſits in Heaven, and <hi>all the Angels of God worſhip him;</hi> yer he doth not diſdain to exerciſe the ſame care, and to expreſs the ſame love to his people, that he did when he was upon Earth. All the Offices of Chriſt expreſs God's love to us; for he feeds us as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> dyed for us as a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> governs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends us as he is <hi>King;</hi> and all theſe meet together in this Title, feeding of us, dying for us, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of us; as he was <hi>God,</hi> he loved us; as he was <hi>Man,</hi> he dyed for us. This doth expreſs the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his two Natures in this Title, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an admirable Evidence, that God is at peace with us.</p>
               <p>It follows, [<hi>Through the Bloud of the Everlaſting Covenant.</hi>] The Bloud of Chriſt, is that which ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God and us together: For you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, our <hi>original peace</hi> with <hi>God</hi> was broken; that peace we have with him now, is called <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> it is as a broken bone, which well ſet, is ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than before, becauſe Nature conveys moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſupplies to the weakeſt part: ſo now, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, through the Bloud of his Son, we ſtand upon ſurer terms with him, then we did in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency: The <hi>Bloud of Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks better things for us, than all our <hi>ſins</hi> ſpeak againſt us; it ſpeaks
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109191:28"/>peace to our ſouls, and that in Heaven, purchaſed by his Death. Chriſt dyed as a <hi>Teſtator,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to the Church a <hi>Legacy of Peace;</hi> he lives as the Executor of that Covenant; and now, in Heaven, conveys to us that bleſſing of peace, which he bequeath'd in his Death. And as our peace was founded in his <hi>Bloud,</hi> ſo it is conſerv'd by his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion;</hi> he appears in the Court of Heaven as out Embaſſador, to make up all thoſe differences, which fall out between God and us: for you know, Amity and Friendſhip is kept between Foreign <hi>States,</hi> bp their Reſidents and Agents, that are kept in their ſeveral Courts; ſo, we have an <hi>Agent</hi> in the Court of Heaven, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that was raiſed from the Dead: And, as a Believer falls into ſin, which is a breach of peace between God and us; ſo that Peace is made up by the Exerciſe of Repentance on our part, and by ſprinkling of Chriſt's Bloud upon us, on God's part. The renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Exerciſe of Repentance, and Application of Chriſt's Bloud, preſerves that peace that is between God and Believers. And (to ſum up the force of the Argument) when we had fallen from God, and it did not conſiſt with the Majeſty of God, to make peace with us without ſatisfaction, then was he pleaſed to pay out Ranſom out of his own Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and redeem us by the Bloud of his Son; ſo that all his <hi>Attributes</hi> might ſhine forth in their luſtre, and glory in our Salvation; and that, upon ſure terms, we might be able to challenge an intereſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>(2) It's called an <hi>Everlaſting Covenant,</hi> as in brings to thoſe that are parties in it an everlaſting glory: So the Lord Jeſus his Bloud is called an <hi>Everlaſting Redemption;</hi> for it ranſoms the ſoul of men from that <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> to which they were liable, and gives them a Title to <hi>everlaſting life;</hi> for thi, Coxenant, which now God hath made with us, it not onely ſecures the <hi>Reward,</hi> but the <hi>Corditions</hi> to which the Reward is made; for God ſaith, I <hi>will plant my fear in your hearts, that you ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
               </p>

For although the World deſpiſe holineſs, as a baſe and contemptible thing, (they had rather be <hi>ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> than <hi>inglorious,</hi> in the eyes of men) and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, they are afraid to be <hi>holy,</hi> leſt they ſhould be the publick ſcorn and contempt of the place wherein they live: although holineſs is of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a price in the World; yet, in Heaven, next to God, Chriſt, and the Spirit, Holineſs is the moſt rich Jewel, that <hi>God</hi> can beſtow upon us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we muſt firſt look upon him, as the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> before we can beg any grace from him. And that is the reaſon, why the Apoſtle repreſents <hi>God</hi> by theſe Titles, that he might encourage the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> to believe, <hi>God</hi> would grant this requeſt. When Chriſt dyed for us, it was not his Deſign on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to quiet our Conſciences, but to quicken our Souls; not onely to free us from <hi>Damnation,</hi> but from the <hi>domination of ſin.</hi> And therefore you ſhall find theſe two are joyned together, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14.) <hi>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have ſeveral times thought, what a day of darkneſs was upon the World, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Sin and Superſtition: When <hi>Chriſt</hi> brought the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> what a day of Darkneſs and Superſtition was on the whole Earth? But you know, what the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, in the wiſdom of God, the World by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God, by the fooliſhneſs of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſave them that believe.</hi>

            <p>YOu will wonder, poſſibly, that I ſhould pitch on the Apoſtles Salutation for my Valediction, and make that the Concluſion of my Preaching, which he made the Beginning of his Writing, and therefore I have made a double Plea for it. I find that this was a form of Bleſſing peculiar to this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, both in the beginning and end of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109191:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>for as there is ſcarcely one Epiſtle but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with it; ſo, many end with it likewiſe: As in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>ver. ult.

            <p>The Order of the words is worth noting, <hi>Grace be to you and peace:</hi> Firſt grace, then peace; for there can be no peace without grace, nor grace, but there will be peace; but there can be no true peace but from God, nor from God, but as he is a Father; nor from God as a Father, but as our Father; and he cannot be ſaid to be our Father, but through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Grace be unto you, and Peace from God our Father, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> both are manifeſted as a golden Chain linked together, not grace without peace, nor peace without grace, but both conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, to cram the believers ſoul with grace and peace. Now from the Order of the words, we might raiſe ſeveral Obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Peace is the fruit of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Grace and Peace are both from God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Love, which is the ſpring of Grace and Peace, is from God as a Father.</p>

            <p n="4">4. That we ſhare not in his Love, but only as he is our Father: All is from propriety.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Our Father,</hi> then <hi>Grace and Peace from God our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That God is our Father onely through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But before we draw any thing from the Text by way of Obſervation, we will ſpeak to the terms by way of Explication. <hi>Grace be to you:</hi> What is here meant by Grace? This is a ſweet word, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and ſtand by Grace; Man that ſhares in the grace of God, is made fellow-Communor with Angels; eats Angels food, and ſhares in Angels bleſſings; Grace is the ſubſtance of the Scripture, the end of the Law, the fulneſs of the Goſpel. <hi>Gregory</hi> calls it, the Heart and Soul of God; I am ſure, Grace is the Heart and Soul of the Word. It's a little word, but it comprehends all good: here is more then <hi>Homers Iliads</hi> in a Nut-ſhell, it's the Epitome of all the good in Heaven and Earth; name any word that ſignifies good to the Soul here, or hereafter, and it is found in the Index, in this little word Grace; Grace comprehends Gods love to us, and out love
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109191:43"/>to God, and as Gods love to us is the ſum of all Mercy, ſo our love to God is the ſum of all Duty; grace is the new birth of the Soul, whereby it takes up another Nature, a new Nature, a ſpiritual God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Nature; as Chriſt was born, and thereby took on him the Nature of man, and was made fleſh, ſo man is born by grace, and thereby takes upon him the Nature of God, and is made Spirit; and here you have at once the great Myſtery of grace in the loweſt debaſement of a Saviour, and the higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of a Sinner; For the Lord Chriſt could not be more debaſed then to be born. It was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo great an abaſement for Chriſt to dye, as for him to be born; for being once made man, it is no wonder for to dye, but being the great God, its a wonder that ever he ſhould be made man. Lo, here is the debaſement of Chriſt; yet if he had been born to a Crown, to Honour, it had been ſomething, but he was born to ſhame, to ſorrow and death. But man by grace is born to a Crown, to a Kingdom, he has a title to all the glory and bleſſedneſs of Heaven from the firſt moment of his new birth; So 'tis in the Text, <hi>Grace be unto you and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peace</hi> in Scripture, is a very comprehenſive term, it carries in it all happineſs. It was the common greeting of the <hi>Jews, Peace be unto you:</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> by his Proxy ſalutes <hi>Nabal, Peace be to thee and thy Houſe;</hi> and the Apoſtle here alludes to this form of Salutation, that he might mix new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mercy, to old Teſtament manners: he firſt ſtiles grace before peace; as <hi>Jacob</hi> did with his Veniſon, he made it a ſavoury meat, ſuch as <hi>Iſaac</hi> loved.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:109191:43"/>
            <p>Peace is the glory of Heaven, in the Boſom of <hi>God,</hi> and brought into the World in the Arms of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; the firſt peace you read of in the Goſpel, was peace by the adminiſtration of Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>And ſuddenly there was with the Angels, a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Heavenly Hoſt, praiſing and ſaying, Glory be to God in the higheſt, and on Earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> And when our Lord Chriſt firſt ſent out his Diſciples, this was the Doctrine that he bid them preach, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.12, 13. <hi>When you come into a houſe, ſalute it; and if it be worthy, let grace, peace, come upon it.</hi> Mark here, by the way, Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is no enemy to good manners, he would not have Chriſtians to be Clowns; which is the uſe of ſome among us, who would have their Religion quarrel with good manners; no, but <hi>in whatſoever City or Town you enter, ſalute it, and let grace, peace, come upon it;</hi> that is, wiſh peace to them, ſaying, <hi>The peace of God be upon this place, upon the head and hearts of all in it.</hi> So that, peace is both a Goſpel-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, when Miniſters and People meet; and it's alſo a Goſpel-valediction, when the Miniſter and the People part. So did the Apoſtle, and ſo do I now, <hi>Grace be with you and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I obſerve, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.13, 14. our Lord bids his Diſciples, when they enter into a houſe, <hi>if the houſe be worthy to let their peace come upon it, but if they be not worthy let grace peace, return unto you.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of leaving peace with them, to <hi>ſhake off the duſt of their feet against them:</hi> that is, to ſhew that <hi>God</hi> will ſhake them off as duſt, and tread them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet as fewel.

Grace be unto you and peace, &amp;c.</hi> not one without the other: though a man may have grace without peace, as in a time of deſertion or temptation; and a man may have peace without grace, as in a ſecure and unregenerate Condition: grace, without peace, is often found in a troubled Conſcience; and peace, without grace, is often found in a ſeared Conſcience: as grace, without peace, is very uncomfortable; ſo peace, without grace, is very unprofitable: like <hi>Rachel,</hi> beautiful, but barren: Therefore, the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ye ſhould have both grace and peace: and we ſay, the Sun and Salt are the moſt uſeful Creatures in the World; the one, for ſhining; the other, for ſeaſoning. My Brethren, grace and peace are the Chriſtian's Sun and Salt; grace is the light of their ſouls, and peace is the ſavour of their comforts; grace ſhines through all their faculties, and peace ſeaſons all their mercies. The bleſſings of God are become as Twins, as Chriſt ſaid of the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.2. <hi>She is like a flock of ſheep that are even, ſhorn, which came up from the waſhing, whereof every one bears twins, and none is barren among them:</hi> Grace and peace here are knit together by the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> in a ſacred knot not to be untyed: As <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> when ſeen together, portend happineſs to the Mariner: ſo when grace and peace are found in a Soul together, they portend the higheſt ſecurity and bleſſing to the Believer: they are ſaid, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be bound together: where <hi>God</hi> gives the one, he never denyes the other: If he gives you me Upper Spring of grace, he will give you the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109191:45"/>Spring of peace, for they go both together. If be gives you the <hi>Dew of Heaven,</hi> you need not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the <hi>fatneſs of the Earth.</hi> If his right hand be <hi>full of merey,</hi> his left hand ſhall not be <hi>empty.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Grace and peace be with us from God the Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Grace has a double ſenſe, either for the grace of <hi>God</hi> to us, that juſtifies us, or the grace of <hi>God</hi> in us, that ſanctifies us. Now there is a diſtant peace flowing from each of theſe, but ſtill its grace and peace.</p>
            <p>Firſt, juſtifying grace has a peace attending that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God.</hi> So far as we have confidence, in juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, there remains no Conſcience of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſin. As there can be no bitterer War, then between Conſcience, and the Cure; ſo there can be no ſweeter peace, then when mercy and peace meet together, and when Conſcience and Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce kiſleth each other. The former, is the taſt of Heaven; the latter, is the perambulation of Heaven; both which, the Believer ſhares in upon his Juſtification by Faith. If Chriſt had peace, who was made our ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> needs muſt the Believer have peace, who is made the righteouſneſs of <hi>God</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sanctifying grace has a peace atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, and this peace differs from the former, as the root from the fruit. The peace of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a radical peace, the root of peace; but the peace of Sanctification is the Bud, the Bloſſom of the Tree: The former flows from the Bloud of Chriſt, ſprinkled on the Conſcience; the latte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from the conformity that is between the Word and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109191:45"/>Will, between the Commands and the Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>As many as walk according to this Rules, grace be unto them and peace,</hi> Gal. 6.16. So that peace is the frui of ſanctifying grace. Now, as the bloud of the Paſchal Lamb (which was a token of peace) was not to be ſtruck on the Poſts of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but upon the Poſts of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> ſo neither is the bloud of ſprinkling, which brings perfect peace, to be ſtruck on the poſts of the carnal ſinner, but on the poſt of the true Believer, an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, in whom there is no guil: no grace, no peace, that is <hi>God</hi>'s Law. How can a ſinner have peace in a ſtate of ſin, when God and Conſcience, when Word and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when Law and Conſcience, and all the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of <hi>God</hi> are againſt the ſinner? <hi>No peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> Pray mark that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it begins with peace, and ends in no peace. In <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. it's ſaid, <hi>He ſhall enter into peace,</hi> that is, the Righteous: In the laſt verſe, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked.</hi> It's the ſtate of grace, that's the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate of peace. And thus I paſs from the double grace deſired, <hi>grace and peace,</hi> to the double Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſcovered, <hi>God our Father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here's a Queſtion to be anſwered: <hi>If Grace and Peace be from God the Father, then how is it ſaid to be from Chriſt? and if from Chriſt, how then from God the Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's a known rule, thar the tranſient, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernal works of <hi>God,</hi> are attributed to all the Three Perſons in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the ſame Works that are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the <hi>Father,</hi> are alſo attributed to the <hi>Son;</hi> and the ſame Works attributed to the <hi>Son,</hi> the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109191:46"/>ſame alſo to the Father: ſo grace and peace are here aſcribed both to <hi>God the Father,</hi> and to our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, they are both from mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and from merit.</p>
            <p>From mercy, on <hi>God</hi>'s part to us; from merits, on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s part for us: They are from <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> becauſe he wills them to us; from <hi>God the Son,</hi> becauſe he works them in us: They are from <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>us;</hi> they are from <hi>God the Father</hi> originally, and from <hi>Chriſt</hi> derivatively, and to <hi>us</hi> actually: <hi>God the Father</hi> is the Fountain of all grace and peace; <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Mediator, is the Conduit of all grace and peace; <hi>Man,</hi> in union to Chriſt, is the Ciſtern, into which theſe ſtreams of grace and peace run: <hi>God</hi> wills grace and peace to us, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> works them in us: <hi>God</hi> gives grace and peace to be applyed to the Creature, this is from the love of the <hi>Father;</hi> but the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this peace to the Soul, is from the merit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Thus you ſee, there's a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spring of this double Bleſſing. Time will not ſerve me further: The onely Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is,</p>
            <p>That all the grace and peace which Believers ſhare in, is derived from <hi>God the Father,</hi> through our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> theſe three things opened, will clear this.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That grace and peace, are the Believer's priviledge.</item>
               <item>2. That the Fountain of this grace and peace is from <hi>God the Father.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. That it is not given out from <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but through <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

            </list>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:109191:46"/>
            <p>Firſt, That grace and peace are the Saints privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; if grace is, then peace is. But grace is the priviledge of every Believer, and that whether you look upon it, as taken from the love and favour of <hi>God</hi> to us: This is the Believers priviledge. God can as well forget Chriſt at his right hand, as ceaſe his love and favour to the Soul of a Believer: The Believers Title to all their bleſſings, ariſes out of this never-failing love of <hi>God;</hi> or if you take grace for the fruit of <hi>God</hi>'s love to the Soul, ſtill it falls to the Believers priviledge: Vocation, Juſtification, Adoption, Pardon of Sin, purging from Sins, ſtrength againſt Sin, Holineſs, Love, Faith, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Perſeverance; all theſe are the priviledges of every Believer: nay, a man cannot be a Believer, without any one of them; they are as eſſential to the being of a Chriſtian, as reaſon to the being of a man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as grace, ſo peace is the Believers priviledge: There is peace Eternal, peace Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, peace Internal, and peace External: There is peace External, this is peace with Men: There is peace Supernal, that is peace with <hi>God:</hi> There is peace Internal, that is peace with Conſcience: All theſe three are to be had upon Earth; and then there's peace Eternal, and that is onely to be had in Heaven. The Apoſtle here doth not exclude the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but chiefly intends the latter: Peace with man, is a good thing to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> to be deſired. Peace with God, is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> things, both within and without, both below and above, both in time and Eternity: ſo ſays <hi>Job, If he gives peace, who
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109191:47"/>then can make trouble?</hi> Now this peace is the Saints priviledge. It is a Legacy left to every Believer, by the laſt Will and Teſtament of a dying Redeemer. Will you ſee a Copy of his Will, then look in <hi>John</hi> 14.27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the World giveth, give I unto you.</hi> There is it ſeems a peace in the Worlds power to give, and there's a peace of Chriſt's beſtowing. Now Chriſt would have us here, not to miſtake the World's peace for his, for the difference is very great: for firſt the World's peace is a falſe peace, it is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Coyn, it has not the currant ſtamp of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on it; but the peace that Chriſt gives to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is true peace, and perfect peace, <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Worlds peace, is an outward peace: It is but skin-deep, it wets the mouth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not waſh the heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. <hi>In laughter, the heart is ſorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heavineſs.</hi> The Worlds peace, is but the ſhell of peace; their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience lowres, when their countenance laughs: but the Peace that Chriſt gives, is an inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, more then in the time that their Corn and their Wine increaſed; [Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart,]</hi> Peace is that gladneſs, that peace ſmooths the <hi>brow,</hi> but this fills the breaſt; as the Sinner has trouble within, in the midſt of all his peace without; ſo a Believer has Pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> thin, in the midſt of all his Troubles with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>

                  </gap> have peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Worlds peace has onely a neather Spring ariſing out of the Creature, out of World<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:109191:47"/>comforts, therefore it muſt needs be unclean; <hi>for an unclean Fountain cannot bring forth clean Water:</hi> But the peace of Chriſtians his an upper Spring, it flows from the manifeſtation of the love of God in Chriſt, it's from the ſprinkling of Chriſt's Bloud on the Conſcience, it flows upon the workings of Chriſt's Spirit upon the Soul, which is firſt a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, then a Comforter: Oh! how pure muſt this Peace be in a Believers Soul, that flow; from ſo pure a Spring?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Worlds peace, is a peace given to Sinners; it's a peace in ſin, and it's a peace with ſin, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, <hi>It's a Covenant with Hell, and an Agreement with Death,</hi> (God deliver us from that peace.) Again, Chriſt's peace is given to none but Believers, it's their priviledge onely, a ſtranger don't intermeddle with his Joy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. <hi>The heart knoweth his own bitterneſs, but a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doth not intermeddle with his Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Worlds peace, is a fading, dying, tranſitory thing, it withers in the Sand, <hi>The trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing of the Wicked is but ſhort, and the joy of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is but for a moment,</hi> Job 20.5. <hi>Solomon</hi> does e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly liken it to the <hi>cracking of Thorns under a Pot,</hi> which is but a blaze, and is gone, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.6. So is the Sinner's peace, it is for a ſpurt, and is ſoon gone; but the peace that Chriſt gives to Believers, is durable and abiding peace: Your Joy no man ſhall take from you, it appears in Life, in Death, and after Death: Firſt, it's our peace in Life, grace brings forth preſent peace. It's ſaid of the Primitive Chriſtians, <hi>They walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the Comforts of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 9.31. It's a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109191:48"/>expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. <hi>In keeping thy Commands, there is great Reward;</hi> he does not fay, for keeping them, which reſpects the end of the Work; but in keeping of them, which looks at the Work it ſelf. My Brethren, Every Duty done in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, reflects a peace in Conſcience, as every flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er carryes its own ſweetneſs: It's poſſible, I grant, a Believer may not always find and feel this peace, few do, ſome ſeldom find it, few find it ſo always: the remains of corruption, breaking forth to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or Temptations to hinder. And God's deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may darken and hide it, and a Believer may ſeem to be totally loſt: yet, in this condition, which is the worſt a Child of God can be in, he hath a double peace.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a Peace in the Promiſes, in this very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: and what you have in Bonds and Bills, you account as good as money in your Pockets.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he has it in the Seed, <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart,</hi> Pſal. 97.11. Grace is the Seed of Peace, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has ſown in the furrows of the Soul, and therefore Peace ſhall ſpring out of the furrows of the Soul: Indeed, this Seed ſprings up ſooner in ſome, then in others; yet every Saint ſhall have a reaping time ſooner, or later, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.6. <hi>He that goeth forth, and weepeth, bearing precious Seed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing, bringing his ſheaves with him:</hi> If he ſtays long for the Fruit, he ſhall have a greater Crop at laſt; if he reaps not now, he ſhall be ſure to reap hereafter, <hi>Pſalm</hi> the 37.37.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109191:48"/>
               <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the and of that man is peace.</hi> Secondly, by this peace which is the peace of a Child of God, its a peace of death; grace will miniſter to us then, and that miniſtration ſhall be peace: The Sinners peace leaves him when he comes to the grave; though in Life it fills him, yet in Death it leaves him. A believer has a two-fold ſpring of peace: The firſt is from above him, the other is from within him: That ſpring that runs with peace above him, is from the bloud of Chriſt, ſprinkled on his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the other that is from within him, is from the ſincerity of his heart, in the wayes of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. My Brethren, when we lie on our Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, and can reflect on our ſincerity in all Gods wayes, this will be peace at laſt, ſo it was in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſaiah 38.3. <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a prefect heart, and have done that which was good in thy ſight.</hi> There's nothing makes a Death-bed ſo hard, and ſo uneaſie, as a life ſpent in the ſervice of ſin and luſt, and nothing makes a Death-bed ſo pleaſant, as a life ſpent in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt. Grace will bring forth Peace, if not in this life; yet, certainly, it will be ſure after Death: if Time brings not this fruit to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet Eternity ſhall; grace in Time, will be glory in Eternity; Holineſſe now, will be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe then; what ever it is a man ſows in this world, that he reaps in the next world: <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap: He that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109191:49"/>that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Sin</hi> ſhall end in ſorrow and miſery, <hi>Grace</hi> ſhall end in peace, in joy, in glory; <hi>Well done thou good and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, enter into the joy of thy Maſter,</hi> Mat. 25.21. Whoſoever ſhares in the grace of Chriſt in this world, ſhall be ſure to ſhare with the joy of Chriſt in the next world, and that joy is joy unſpeakable, and full of glory. I will wind up all in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Application, by way of exhortation to three ſorts of perſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, To ſuch as have this grace and peace.</p>

               </gap>e thankfully the Father and Son, the Fathers Grace, and the Sons Love, for both had a hand in this; therefore bleſſe both the Father for willing it to us, and the Son for working it in us. Grace and Peace are the fruits' of <hi>Gods</hi> eternal Election: for this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Father gives; but the Aplication of it to us is the fruit of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Redemtion and Interceſſion; How can you think of Hell and damnation, and ſee your ſelf freed from it; And how can you think of the Dreadfull Fury and Vengence of God, your ſelf not under it? How can you look on your ſtate changed, your hearts renewed, grace ratified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and your Conſcience quieted? How can you think of theſe things, but muſt admire the love of the Father in giving this to you, and the love of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109191:49"/>the Son in purchaſing this for you? All the grace and mercy that is given to us, is by Chriſt purchaſed for us; Grace and Peace are fruits of the redeeming bloud of Chriſt purchaſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Do not envy the conditions or poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the men of the world; they have Riches and Honours, Proſits, and Pleaſures, but they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have Grace nor Peace. Therefore do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy their happineſs. There is a ſtory of a <hi>Romane</hi> that was condemned by the Court-Martial to die for breaking his ranke to ſteal a bunch of Grapes; and as he was going to his Execution, his fellow Souldiers laughed at him, and others envyed at him, that he ſhould have Grapes and they none: Now (ſayes he) do not envy me for my bunch of Grapes, for you would be loth to have them at the rate I muſt pay for them. (My Brethren) You that are the Children of Grace and peace, don't envy at the men of the world, at their Riches, their Comforts, their Pleaſures; for I am ſure you would be loth to have them at the price they pay for them: for the end of theſe things are Death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Don't complain of the worſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Providence of God ſhall caſt you into; in this world it may be you ſhall ſuffer hard things, but remember, ſo long as thy ſoul is ſecure, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver complain of hard things. (My Brethren) As God your <hi>Father</hi> brought you into a ſtate of Grace and Peace, and thereby ſecured his love to your ſouls in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> can you complain of hard things? So let the joy of the Lord be your ſtrength; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord alwayes, and again</hi> I <hi>ſay, Rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 4.4.</p>

            <p>They may have the world's peace, but they have none of this Peace; let me beg of you to get out of this graceleſs condition: if you love your Souls, don't live one day, nor one hour, nor one moment longer in a graceleſs ſtate.

Oh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this as a Teſtimony I leave with you, that the love of <hi>Sin,</hi> and lack of <hi>Grace,</hi> will ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy every Soul at laſt: But you will ſay, <hi>How ſhall I get a ſhare in this grace and peace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, Break off all your f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lſe peace: we can never have true peace with God, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelve; with falſe peace; you will never ſeek that peace which Chriſt hath purchaſed for you, while you content your ſelves with that curſed peace which the Old man has wrought in you: Oh therefore, break off all falſe peace, which is not the fruit of Grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Labour to ſee, and be convinced of the miſerable, and of the naked condition your Souls be in for want of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for a covering: without this, oh Soul, thou art miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wretched, poor and naked. Be convinced alſo, what a miſerable thing it is, to have God our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: God is the ſinners Enemy; it is a fearful thing, to fall into the hands of the living God: Oh be convinced of thy nakedneſs, without Chriſts
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109191:50"/>righteouſneſs, and thy emptineſs without his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Labour to go out of your ſelves to Chriſt for grace and peace: ſurely in the Lord ſhall one ſay, I have righteouſneſs and ſtrength. I, there it's to be found. Labour for a thirſty frame of Soul, for the promiſes run farr to ſuch, <hi>that he will fill the hungry with good things.</hi> Go to Chriſt, oh Soul, begg, pray, never leave God, till he hath given thee an intereſt in Chriſt, <hi>for none can come to me, except the Father draw him:</hi> there is no pardon for the leaſt ſin out of Chriſt, but there is pardon for the greateſt ſin in Chriſt; one ſin will damn the Soul out of Chriſt, but no ſin can hurt the Soul in Chriſt. Oh go to Chriſt, Soul, never give reſt to thy eyes, nor ſlumber to thy lids, till thou haſt made peace with God in the bloud of Chriſt: one ſting of the fiery Serpent was mortal, without looking upon the brazen Serpent: So one ſin will damn a Soul out of Chriſt, but no ſin can damn a Soul in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To ſuch as have grace, but no ſenſe of peace, this is the counſel I would leave with all ſuch. Be much in the exerciſe of grace, pray much, believe much, uſe grace much, for the exerciſe and improving of grace will produce peace: There are ten duties which are to be the ſphere of grace in activity, and in performing of them, we ſhall have peace: Firſt make Religion your buſineſs, the main deſign of your lives, be Chriſtians to purpoſe; be not only Chriſtians by the bye, but <hi>let your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Christ.</hi> Phil. 1.27.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:109191:51"/>
            <p>Secondly, Put forth renewed Acts of Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Chriſt every day, and remember, it's as much your duty to believe in Chriſt to day, as if you had never believed before. Oh live by Faith every day, and this will bring peace to you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Maintain a conſtant Communion with God daily: this Communion with God is man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> chief good; the happineſs of a Child is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his Father, and the happineſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Wife is in communion with her Husband, and this is the happineſs of a Believers Soul, communion with God the Father, through Chriſt our Head and Husband: The ſeed of peace, its true, it is low<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the Soul in Union; but then it takes root down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and brings forth fruit upward. Spiritual peace will never be obtained, if communion with God be not maintained; that gives comfort in the midſt of all ſorrows, and ſatisfies all doubts, and reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences all wants. Lo, this is the fruit of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Be good at all times; but of all, beſt in bad times; many Chriſtians loſe their peace, by remitting of their grace, and let looſe their reins of Religion, to avoid the cenſures of a crooked gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. A Chriſtians zeal ſhould be like the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fire, that burns the hotteſt when the Air is cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; or like the Lilly, that looketh beautiful, though among Thorns; ſo ſhould a Child of God, though among ſinners.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, In all conditions, chuſe ſufferings, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſinning; If ever you would have peace, chooſe ſuffering rather then ſinning; he that value<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> peace with God, or peace with Conſcience, he muſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109191:51"/>make this his choyce: thus <hi>Daniel</hi> rather choſe to be caſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Lions, then to loſe the peace of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; the three Children choſe rather to burn in the Furnace, then bow to the Image: One ſaid, <hi>He would rather go to Hell free from ſin, then to live in Heaven with guilt on his Conſcience.</hi> (My Brethren) let me a little enlarge, becauſe ſuffering may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us; for Perſecution is the genius of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: therefore let me leave 4 ſhort Rules with you concerning ſufferings.</p>
            <p>See that your Cauſe be good, your Call be clear, your Spirit meek, and your End right. Sufferings cannot bring out peace without either of them; but with them all our ſufferings ſhall be peace.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let your Cauſe be good, its not the bloud, but the cauſe that makes a Martyr; its not for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cauſe, a Chriſtian ſhould engage to ſuffer: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cauſe will no more bear ſuffering, then every little ſtream will bear a Ship; nor will Chriſt let go ſwee neſs to every ſuffering, 1 Pet. 4.15. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as a Murderer, or as a Thief, or as an Evil doer, or as a buſie-body in other mens matters.</hi> To ſuffer thus, is neither Chriſtian-like, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. Some ſuffer rather as Malefactors, then as <hi>Chriſts</hi> Martyrs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let your Call be clear; its amiſs, to have a good cauſe without a call: Some may ſuffer for the cauſe of <hi>God,</hi> and yet ſin in ſuffering for want of a call. Chriſt calls not all to ſuffer: to ſome it is given, to others it is not. If thy call be clear, thy peace will be ſweet, though thy ſufferings be never ſo great. But you will ſay, How ſhall I know when I am called to ſuffer?</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:109191:52"/>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, when Truth ſuffers by our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, then are we called to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when our lives will be the denyal of Chriſt, then are we called to deny our lives for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When ſin and ſuffering ſurrounds us, that we cannot get out; but we muſt either run through ſin or ſufferings, then I may ſafely conclude that Chriſt called me to ſuffer, and in this cauſe we may expect the peace and ſweetneſs of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third Direction for ſuffering, is this. Our ſpirit muſt be meek; ſo was Chriſt, he went as a Lamb to the ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>Its poſſible, a man may be right in his cauſe, and yet ſinful in his carriage; and if ſo, no wonder if Chriſt be not ſweet to us. To be fierce, and raging, and reviling in ſuffering, its not becoming humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore much leſſe like Chriſtianity. A Chriſtian ſhould be like <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Acts 45. <hi>And they departed from the preſence of the Councel, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his Name.</hi> It becomes thoſe that are found in the Spirit, to give bleſſing for curſing; the more of <hi>Christs</hi> ſpirit is in us in our ſufferings, the more comfort and joy we ſhall receive from our ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, See that your end in ſuffering be right, if it be Self, or ſingularity, or ſchiſm, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be ſweet to thee. Some have died, that their name<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> might live. <hi>Socrates</hi> died in the defence of the truth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and to prove, that there is but one God; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he died for honour, applauſe, or for Gods ſake I think it is no hard thing to determine. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:109191:52"/>thy cauſe be good, thy call clear, thy ſpirit meek, and thy end right, and then you ſhall have peace in all your ſufferings: that is the fifth thing. Chooſe ſuffering, rather then ſinning.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would have peace, be much in ſtudying the Scriptures: for as God is the God of peace, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Prince of peace, ſo the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is the Goſpel of peace, which <hi>God</hi> hath given thee to lead thee in the wayes of peace, <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, Take heed of Apoſtacy, either in Doctrine or Principles. Though a Believer is freed from Apoſtacy in the ſtate of grace, yet he is not freed from Apoſtacy in the degrees of grace. He may fall ſinfully, though he cannot fall finally. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> fell by one, St. <hi>Peter</hi> by the other. Pray with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 17.5. <hi>Hold up my goings in thy path, that my foot-ſteps ſlip not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, Make the Word of <hi>God</hi> your Rule in all things; be ſure you have a Scripture-warrant for all your practiſes. But eſpecially, keep cloſe to Scripture, in matters of <hi>Gods</hi> Worſhip.</p>
            <p>There are endleſs Diſcourſes about the Mode of <hi>Gods</hi> Worſhip; I have no diſputing-time. It is good in difficult caſes, always to take the ſureſt ſide. For Inſtance: If I follow the Traditions of man, for the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> I may ſin; but if I keep cloſe to the directions of <hi>God</hi> in the Scripture, I am ſure I cannot ſin; for this is the ſure word of Prophecy, to which you do well to take heed, therefore in ſuch a doubtful caſe, <hi>Gods</hi> will is, that we take the ſureſt ſide: go to the Law and to the Teſtament; Labour to be fruitful and grounded Chriſtians.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:109191:53"/>
            <p>Ninthly, Keep up the power of godlineſs, do not let Religion down into a life-leſs formality; <hi>The Righteous ſhall flouriſh like a Palm-tree: He ſhall grow like a Cedar in</hi> Lebanon; <hi>thoſe that be planted in the Houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God,</hi> Pſal. 92.12, 13. My Brethren, it is as much a duty in them that have grace, to improve it, as for them that have no grace, for to get it. If you ſit under the daily means, the daily waterings of <hi>God,</hi> and do not grow; do you think this will be peace in the latter end, ſurely no (my Brethren) your fruitfulneſs under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is of very great concernment. It is unfruitfulneſs that makes <hi>God</hi> lay his <hi>Vineyard waſte.</hi> Its fruitfulneſs that procures the forwarding your account in the day of grace.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Obſerve that excellent rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in <hi>Phil.</hi> 48. <hi>Finally, Brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I have ſpoken to the former of theſe, <hi>They ſhall walk with Christ;</hi> and that the Scripture holds forth under a two-fold notion:</p>
            <p>Firſt, As matter of duty; It is a duty to walk with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a matter of Promiſe: They that keep their Garments undefiled, and live in high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with Chriſt, they ſhall walk with Chriſt: we favour thoſe that walk with us.</p>
            <p>Walking with Chriſt, notes to us three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we have peace with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we have intimacy with him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That his being ſo much above us, we ſhould have this favour from him.</p>
            <p>And hence I noted, the great priviledge of the People of God, that they ſhall walk with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It notes, the great ſatisfaction of the Saints, to walk with Chriſt: they ſhall be filled with his company.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How ſafe it is, and what ſafety there is to walk with Chriſt: he hath a Wing to ſpread over them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What opportunities ſuch have, as walk with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What liberty ſuch have as walk with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Such as walk with Chriſt, may be ſure he will communicate his ſecrets to them, he will ſhew them what they have to do.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:109191:54"/>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhewed you the great goodneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, that he would take ſuch Creatures to walk with him, ſuch defiled Creatures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then let us take heed of keeping our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments undefiled, leſt Jeſus Chriſt caſt us out of his company, and we can no longer walk with Chriſt any more. Oh! take heed of walking blameleſs in the ways of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were ſpoken from the firſt Point: Now I come to the walking with Chriſt <hi>in white.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In opening the Text, I told you <hi>white</hi> might be conſidered two ways:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it reſpects our ſtate, and ſo that by way of Juſtification, and thus they ſhall walk with Chriſt; but this is not the walking <hi>in white</hi> the Text means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is a further walking <hi>in white,</hi> and that is matter of reward to the people of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To walk with Chriſt <hi>in white,</hi> it is matter of honour, <hi>white garments</hi> are matter of honour. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, great Kings walk <hi>in white garments,</hi> ſo the Saints of God ſhall walk <hi>in white.</hi> Chriſt will honour them, and give them honour among them, becauſe they have kept their Garments undefiled. They ſhall walk <hi>in white</hi> like great Princes, and honoured Perſons. <hi>A good name is better then precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> They that are good indeed they ſhall have a good name, they ſhall walk <hi>in white.</hi> To keep the Conſcience clean, is to keep the Credit clean, and they who are careful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they be not blotted, that they walk with me in honour.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:109191:55"/>
            <p>'Twas worthily ſpoken in the 11. of the <hi>Hebrews, They kept their garments undefiled,</hi> and it was by the power of Faith, and they obtained a good report by Faith, keeping themſelves from the pollutions of the World, they kept themſelves a good report. This honour and good report which we get, by keeping our Garments undefiled, is ſure: <hi>Abraham</hi> had an honourable Title, <hi>Abraham, My Friend, and a man after my own heart,</hi> Iſa. 45.4. <hi>Since thou wast precious in my ſight, thou wast honourable;</hi> and not onely ſo, that the people of God are honourable in his eyes, but they alſo ſometimes walk <hi>in white,</hi> in the eyes of the men of the World: he can give his people room in the opinions of men, he moves their hearts to think well of them, and he opens their mouths to ſpeak well of them; though indeed the honour which they, who keep their Garments undefiled, have in this World, it is moſt uſually from good men, from godly men: and indeed, honour of them is moſt honourable.</p>
            <p>It is not much to us, what others ſay or think of us what the wicked World judge of us; yet, I ſay, God can, and doth ſometimes raiſe a Teſtimony of honour for his people, amongſt carnal men of the World. <hi>Joſeph</hi> would not defile his Garments, he walked in <hi>white</hi> amongſt men: true, he was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſon, what of that? he was reſpected by the Keeper of the Priſon, and afterward he walked in <hi>white.</hi>

               </gap> men of the World; firſt with the Prince of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> he had tender favour with him, he told him he would not diſobey
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109191:55"/>God, to pleaſe men; yet he did not rail againſt him, and call him a ſtubborn fellow, becauſe he would not bow to <hi>Baal;</hi> and afterwards <hi>Daniel</hi> was as great a man as any in all that Province; he walked <hi>in white.</hi> God hath created Teſtimonies of honour for his people, from ſome men of the World; yea, they many times put <hi>white Garments</hi> upon them: ſo it was with Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.4. common-men put a good report upon Chriſt, a <hi>white Garment. Truly, ſaith the Centurion, this was the Son of God. Truly, this was a righteous man,</hi> ſaith he; when he ſaw how he carryed himſelf at his death, he gave him a good report: Thus it doth come to paſs, God doth ſometimes keep up their honour in the World, who will not defile their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor touch the Sacrifice of <hi>Baal;</hi> and it falls out ſo with them, that the Lord ſhall clear up their credit and reputation, and they ſhall walk <hi>in white, in honour,</hi> before the men of the World. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.11. where the Souls under the Altar are ſpoken of, who were miſerably uſed in this World, <hi>white Robes</hi> were given them, to every one of them, that is, their Evidences were cleared.</p>
            <p>This may teach us the readieſt way to the <hi>white Robe,</hi> to the <hi>Robe of Honour,</hi> it is to keep us from being defiled with ſinful practices: certainly, they who pleaſe God, he can make he World to honour them; if God approves us, he can make the world approve us too; yet we muſt not think to have all men ſpeak well of us: yet this we may ſay, if we keep our Garments undefiled, we ſhall walk in <hi>white</hi> in the eyes of men, if God ſee our Garments in the dirt, and ſpotted with the filth of the World,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109191:56"/>it will ſpoil the honour we ſhould have in the World: as it was ſaid of <hi>Arius,</hi> when his garments were defiled, they called him <hi>Satanarius,</hi> that is to ſay, deviliſh: Thus it may be, for the Lord hath a time to take our good name from us, to cauſe our light of honour to be taken from us.</p>
            <p>And as he hath cauſed us to walk in the <hi>white</hi> of honour in the world, ſo he doth ſometimes cauſe us to walk in reproach with the World: they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file their Garments, loſe their honour with men, and they loſe their joy they ſhould have hereafter, <hi>Mal,</hi> 2.9. <hi>You have departed from my Law, therefore will I make you contemptible in the eyes of all men.</hi> It is a deſign of the ſpirit of wickedneſs, to draw men to ſin, that they may upbraid them; that, I conceive, is the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.13. <hi>For neither they themſelves who are circumciſed keep the Law, but deſire to have you circumciſed, that they might glory in your fleſh,</hi> ſaith he: Oh there are ſome of this wicked Spirit, that would draw men to ſuch and ſuch wickedneſs, not that they joy in their return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but that they might glory in their fleſh, when as they who ſtand faſt, do even force a good Teſtimony from their Enemies: So it was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy chance of <hi>Cranmer:</hi> the Papiſts did perſwade him to ſubſcribe, and did he get any honour by it? No truly, they did upbraid him, and reproach him, and ſo he had dyed in a raving condition, had not the Lord been merciful to him. I remember a ſpeech of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> about drinking of Healths: Oh! ſay they, 'tis upon the King's Birth-day, and we cannot avoid it; If we deny it, ſay they, we ſhall be reproached and ſcorned of men. He gives
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109191:56"/>them many Anſwers to it; but one, as I remember, was this, <hi>God will ſo work, that if you will not comply with them, they, in their hearts, will honour you; and whereas if you did comply with them, they would diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you, and ſay you are baſe ſpirited.</hi> That is one thing of this Point, that keeping cloſe to Jeſus Chriſt, will get you this Reward; you ſhall walk with him in the <hi>white</hi> of honour: they ſhall walk in the <hi>white</hi> of honour with his People, and it may be with the World too.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>They ſhall walk in white,</hi> in the <hi>white</hi> of peace, and joy, and inward comfort.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed you, in the opening of the Text, how the Scripture calls that walking <hi>in white.</hi> Then the Point is this: What ever becomes of the other white of honour in the World, they ſhall be ſure of this, that abundance of peace, and joy, and comfort, ſhall poſſeſs their ſouls, that keep their garments white; they ſhall walk in the inward white of joy and peace with Jeſus Chriſt, and this is a bleſſed Reward.</p>
            <p>Indeed, now this joy, this white of joy, ariſes in the Soul three ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="3">3. In the third place, let it be a word of Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Admonition to all at this day, to take heed of defiling their garments: If you defile your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Chriſt will pronounce another ſentence, he will pronounce a ſentence againſt you, he hath threatnings for thoſe who defile their garments, in the place of rewards, for thoſe who keep them clean. They who defile their garments, ſhall walk in garments of black, in the black of diſhonour: as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I walk all day mourning without the Sun:</hi> the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhall not ſhine upon them; Oh what bitter and ſowre things have many taſted for defiling their garments, when for favour of men, or to pleaſe men, they have ſtained their own gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! What ſad &amp; bitter things hath been upon them? how hath conſcience riſen up againſt them? Oh take heed of the After-claps of conſcience, I may ſay, take heed of the Thunder-claps of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for they will come upon you one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you defile your garments: As they who to pleaſe men defile their garments, often fall into their diſpleaſure, whoſe favour they ſought: ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, ſuch fall into diſpleaſure with themſelves, or, to be ſure, they ſhall at laſt: there is many a one lives under the dis-favour of his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, many a one, that his conſcience will not give him a good word, or good look, whence hath it been? they have defiled their garments. They who venture to do things diſpleaſing to God, ſhall not long be pleaſing to themſelves.</p>

And there is a loathing of deſpair, and that is the loathing there meant: the Hypocrite ſhall loath his own hope, that is, he ſhall loath it deſpairing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 'Tis an affliction to be loathed by men, but 'tis a dreadfull judgement, to be loathed of our ſelves deſpairingly; this is the ſuburbs of hell, for this will be the portion of the damned for ever, for their vanity, for their madneſſe, 'tis next to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Hell, for their worm dyeth not; and that is the worm of Conſcience: Oh therefore take heed, Conſcience may be ſilent, yea, it may flatter for a time; but when Conſcience is provok'd, it will ſpeak, yea thunder.</p>

            <p>Let me give you but a three-fold Conſider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aion, to ſtir you up to an exceeding Exactneſs and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe not to defile your garments, ſeeing there is ſuch a reward promiſed, ſuch a Habit of White promiſed, as this White, wherein we ſhall walk with Jeſus Chriſt. I is an Angelical Happineſſe; ſo much Heaven is come down upon you, while ye have this White. 'Tis Heaven before Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.3. the Angel that came down to the Sepulchre of Chriſt, his Raiment was white as the Light. The Martyrs when they had An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Apparitions, they alwayes appeared to them in white; as one upon the Rack thought he felt an Angel ſupplying him, while his enemies tormented him.</p>
            <p>Chriſt calls the Phariſees <hi>whited Sepulchres;</hi> they were not white, but whited Sepulchres: that is a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal condition to be whited like a Sepulchres. Thus it is with thoſe who defile themſelves, they are whited walls, and whited Sepulchres. They that keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves white, ſhall walk in white, ſhall have Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider, This white, or walking in white, is ſuch as conquers all the blackneſs of this world: tis not poſſible for the world to alter the coulour of this white, how much dirt ſoever they put upon it, this white will be white ſtill; they cannot turn it to be black, they cannot take away this peace, this joy from us; they cannot ſtrip us of this habit: they may pull off our fine garments,

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich; as having nothing, yet freely poſſeſſing all things.</hi> The world may put us into a ſad eſtate as to the world, yet we are not out of our White gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menty, alwayes rejoycing, <hi>Haba.</hi> 3.13. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom. neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines, the labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, and the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhalt be no herd in the ſtalls; this cannot take away the White garments; no, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> 'Tis a conquering joy, turns all ſorrow into joy, and blackneſſe to white; therefore keep clean.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider this: This White of peace and joy, as 'tis a joy unconquerable, ſo 'tis that will be with us moſt, when we moſt need it: when wordly joyes are fartheſt from us, then this joy will be near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; that is a marvellous comfort, to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in its ſeaſon. The Martyrs who have kept themſelves white, have had this White, and walk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in this white; but, when they had moſt need of it, and came actually to ſuffering, then they have had moſt of it. This is a bleſſed thing! This the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Jeſus Chriſt have given witneſſe of, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have had peace and joy in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences at other times, yet never ſo much as in the hour of temptation. When they have been call into the Cole-houſe, they have had white <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; when they have been caſt into priſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and dungeons, how have they rejoyced? 'Tis ſaid,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109191:61"/>of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> they were men that kept their garments undefiled, and they had a great deal of peace and joy when they were put into the Stocks and Dungeons, then they ſung at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: What an enlargment of heart had they at that time!</p>
            <p>So in the Stories of ancient and latter Time, how have they rejoyced, and gon triumphing to Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? For then Chriſt gives moſt of this White: It hath been the uſe of Perſecutors to put filthy garments upon the Martyrs, drawing pictures of Devils upon them; and as their malice hath riſen to the hight (in that time of ſufferings) to make them look like Devils, then the love of Chriſt hath riſen to the hight, and they have been full of peace and joy at that time; therefore be encouraged to walk with Chriſt in this White. This white is an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Habit, 'tis an unconquerable Habit, and 'tis that will be with us moſt, when we have moſt need of it. I ſhould have added a third: As walking with Chriſt is an honour, and 'tis walking in the white of peace and joy;</p>
            <p>So thirdly, 'tis a truth of walking with Chriſt in the white of glory, as in the Tran figuration, which was a Type of Heaven, <hi>Chriſts rayment was White, ſo as no Fuller on earth was able to whiten it;</hi> and that is it which I might have ſpoken of to you, that they who keep their garments undefiled here, ſhall be ſure of that, to walk with Chriſt in glory hereafter. If we ſhould miſſe of the white of Honour, and have not much of the white of Joy, yet be ſure we ſhall walk with Chriſt in the white of Glory.</p>
            <p>I would only ſay this to you, That as I have from
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109191:62"/>this Text, and many more, laboured to bring port Souls into a white ſtate, to a ſtate of Juſtification, to a ſtate of Holineſſe. And as I have been preſſing you to keep your garments white, that you may be in the habit of White, as your Reward; ſo it ſhall be the deſire and prayer of my heart, that if I ſhould have no more opportunities among you, that as you have been ſtirred up to get into this white of Grace, that you and I may meet in the white of Glory, where we ſhall never part.</p>
            <p>Here are three whites: The white of Honour is good, the white of Peace and joy is very good, the white of Glory is beſt of all: That is the anſwer of all our Prayers, and that is the iſſue of all our Working; then we ſhall have as much as we can hold for ever.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109191:64"/>inexcuſable for them, among whom leſs mighty work have been done. If they do not comply with the deſign of God, their condition will be far more intolerable: They that have been lifted up to <hi>Heaven</hi> as it were, that have as it were ſeen Chriſt crucified before their eyes, for them to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize, and turn away from Chriſt; <hi>of how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy?</hi> Certainly, thoſe very perſons, that have great and mighty works done among them, and upon them too, great Convictions, and ſtrong Reſolutions, and yet they ſhall apoſtatize: oh! how will God upbraid theſe perſons? Now ſee that other Text, that ſpeaks as dreadful as this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4.5, and 6 verſes. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned, and have taſted of the Heavenly gift, and were made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good Word of God, and the powers of the World to come, if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again to repentance: Seeing they crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi> It is the greateſt diſgrace and affront that man can put upon Chriſt, to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize from him (it is not half ſo much not to own him) for by that they crucifie him again, and put him to an open ſhame: it is as if they told all the World, that this Chriſt is not worth the believing in, and it were but to throw away their time and happineſs to believe in him.

            <p>Now Beloved, conſider how many abide thus to this day in <hi>Darkneſs: Dead in ſin,</hi> and <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> When you are, or pretend to be, tranſlated out of this <hi>darkneſs, into his marvellous light;</hi> will not You hold faſt? You that were dead, as well as others, and now you live; is this your requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to God, that you will now let it go? Oh! I beſeech you, have a care of that.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us conſider, what we <hi>are by Faith;</hi> and that will be another Obligation upon us. We were not ſo <hi>bad before Faith;</hi> but we are <hi>better by Faith.</hi> We were not in ſo miſerable a caſe <hi>before</hi> believing, but we are in as happy a caſe <hi>when we do believe.</hi> Why, what are we? We are alive, and <hi>Children of Light,</hi> and <hi>Children of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are alive: You hath he quickned, ſaith he or made alive; and, <hi>My Son that was dead, is alive.</hi> Now, what is the work of the Living? It is to praiſe God, <hi>The Living, the Living, they ſhall praiſe thee as I do this day.</hi> Now if this be the work of the Living, then conſider, if we hold not faſt our Faith; if we apoſtatize, we are ſo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of the Living, that is, of praiſing <hi>God,</hi> that we do all the diſhonour we can to God; we do the work of dead men; <hi>Yea, we are twice dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Light: Ye were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but now are light in the Lord.</hi> Now it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervable, what the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109191:65"/>the children of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and the Children of the <hi>light,</hi> I Theſ. 5.5. <hi>You Believers,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are all the Children of the light, and the children of the day, we are not of the night, nor of darkneſs;</hi> and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>therefore let not us ſleep, as do others; but let us watch, and be ſober:</hi> why? <hi>for they that ſleep, ſleep in the night; and they that be drunk, be drunk in the night:</hi> if any ſtagger, this is the work of the <hi>night,</hi> this is not the work of the <hi>day:</hi> Now every <hi>Apoſtate</hi> that wavers, he is like a man that is drunk, ſo that he acts clean contrary to the Children of the day. Saith he, <hi>They that are drunk, are drunk in the night;</hi> but, ſaith he, <hi>Let us watch and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ſober, and let us who are of the day, put on the Breaſt-plate of Faith, and for a Helmet, the hope of ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are by believing, <hi>the Children of God,</hi> Gal. 3.26. <hi>For ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> now, Beloved, are we weary of ſo honourable a Title, as being <hi>the Children of God?</hi> why, we are <hi>the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Will any body part with ſo great a Title as this? why, if we are weary of being Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whoſe can we be? none but the Devils? and had we rather be the Devils children then Gods: there are but theſe two, either you muſt be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, or the Devils children: now <hi>you are the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us hold faſt the <hi>profeſſion of our Faith,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Faith, we are the children of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let us conſider, what we ſhall be at the end of Faith: why, we ſhall be ſaved, 1 Pet. 1.4, 5, and 9. verſes compared, <hi>He hath begotten us to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:109191:66"/>an Inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, that fades not away, reſerved in Heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through Faith unto ſalvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt times;</hi> and in the 9th Verſe, ſaith he, <hi>receiving the end of your Faith, even the ſalvation of your ſouls;</hi> ſo that, it ſeems, to be weary of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, is to be weary of being ſaved; not to hold faſt Faith, is not to hold faſt ſalvation; for, ſaith he, <hi>You are ſaved through Faith, and the end of your Faith is the ſalvation of your Souls.</hi> Can you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be damned? Can you have patience to think of going to Hell? Now, put all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wil you not hold faſt? you that before faith were but darkneſs, were but dead, were but <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath,</hi> who <hi>by Faith</hi> are made <hi>children of light,</hi> are made <hi>alive,</hi> and the <hi>children of God;</hi> and who at the <hi>end of Faith,</hi> ſhall receive the ſalvation of our ſouls; And ſhall not we hold faſt? ſhall we leave this Faith? but then ſecondly,</p>
            <p>A 2d Argument in the Text ſhall be drawn from the <hi>Object,</hi> and that is twofold: there is <hi>faith;</hi> and the <hi>profeſſion of this faith,</hi> that is to be held f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt; and there are Arguments from both: firſt, <hi>Faith;</hi> hold faſt <hi>faith:</hi> why are we ſo greatly concerned, and ſo hugely obliged to hold faſt <hi>Faith?</hi> I will give you this one Reaſon for it, it is the moſt <hi>holy Faith,</hi> there are many things may be <hi>called Faith,</hi> that may not be called moſt <hi>holy Faith:</hi> there are many faiths that are at leaſt called holy: <hi>Turkiſh Faith,</hi> is by them called holy faith: the <hi>Romiſh Faith,</hi> is by them called holy faith: I, but this is the moſt holy faith: there is an expreſſion that <hi>Jude</hi> hath, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109191:66"/>faith to us, in the 20 verſe of his Epiſtle; <hi>But ye beloved, building up your ſelves on your moſt holy faith, &amp;c.</hi> Let other pretenders be as holy as they can, they can never riſe to the holineſs of this: this is the moſt holy faith, it is holy in ſo high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to be beyond compare. I, but now, what is it that may denominate this faith to be the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith? why, it hath for its <hi>Authour</hi> the <hi>moſt holy God,</hi> it is the <hi>gift</hi> of God, and the <hi>Work</hi> of God, if we take it for the <hi>Act</hi> of Faith; and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of God, if we take it for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Faith. There are as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gods many, but we know but one moſt holy God:</hi> there are that will be called your <hi>holineſs</hi> in the World; but this is the moſt holy God, a God that is <hi>glorious in holineſs,</hi> yea, whoſe <hi>glory</hi> it is to be <hi>holy.</hi> There is nothing ſtamps <hi>glory</hi> on any <hi>ſubject</hi> like <hi>holineſs:</hi> what is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> but <hi>holineſs?</hi> that is their <hi>glory,</hi> The <hi>holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi> and that is their <hi>ſhame,</hi> the <hi>ſinful Angels;</hi> and what was it that made <hi>Canaan</hi> a better Land than another: was it not the <hi>holineſs?</hi> it was the <hi>holy Land:</hi> what was it that made the <hi>Temple</hi> a better place then <hi>another?</hi> was it not, becauſe it was the <hi>holy Temple?</hi> yea, it is the <hi>glory</hi> of all the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, that they are holy. His <hi>Juſtice</hi> would look like <hi>ſeverity,</hi> but that it is holy: His <hi>Power</hi> would look like <hi>Tyranny,</hi> were it not <hi>holy:</hi> His <hi>Love</hi> would look like <hi>fondneſs,</hi> were it not <hi>holy:</hi> His <hi>patience</hi> would look like a <hi>toleration</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> were it not <hi>holy:</hi> therefore it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord God, glorious in holineſs.</hi> Now this moſt holy God is <hi>the Authour</hi> of this Faith, and ſo it is a moſt holy Faith; it being the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109191:67"/>Work of the moſt holy God; and will you <hi>leave,</hi> and not <hi>hold faſt</hi> this moſt <hi>holy Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then beſides, It may be ſaid to be the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith in this ſenſe too, that it is its <hi>nature</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes to make the <hi>ſubject</hi> in whom it is, <hi>moſt holy:</hi> Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>you hath God choſen,</hi> to wit, by Faith, <hi>to be a peculiar people, a holy Nation.</hi> Acts 15.9. it is ſaid, <hi>He hath purifyed their hearts by faith,</hi> and <hi>he will give them an Inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith.</hi> It may be called the moſt holy Faith, in theſe two reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſidering the operation and <hi>effects</hi> it hath upon the <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> of them in whom it is; it makes them a <hi>holy People,</hi> beyond all the people in the World: And then upon this account too, as to the <hi>ultimate effects</hi> of it, that it <hi>admits</hi> us into the <hi>moſt holy places.</hi> You know, he <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to <hi>enter into the Holy of Holies,</hi> that is, into <hi>Heaven.</hi> Now this doth admit us into the moſt holy place, where that moſt holy God is: ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>having therefore boldneſs to enter into the holiest, by the bloud of Joſus:</hi> Alas, in them me of <hi>old,</hi> they could go but into the <hi>outward Court;</hi> but now, ſaith he, <hi>We all have this boldneſs, to enter into the moſt holy place by the bloud of Jeſus.</hi> Shall we leave ſuch a Faith as this? ſhall we not hold faſt the moſt holy Faith, that that is from the moſt holy God, that makes the moſt holy people, and that admits us into the moſt holy place? Where do we find ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith as this is? if you leave this Faith that is <hi>ſo good</hi> in it <hi>ſelf,</hi> a Faith that doth ſo much good to us; and, which is better, that <hi>makes us ſo good;</hi> for it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109191:67"/>is much better to be made good, than to have good done unto us; and, beloved, what will it avail us, if God ſhould do us good all our dayes, if we be not made good? If we ſhould have the good of <hi>health</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> and <hi>long life;</hi> and yet not be <hi>made good</hi> all this while, it avails us not: now this is the <hi>nature</hi> of Faith, it is <hi>good</hi> in it ſelf, it doth good to us, and it makes us good: therefore, Beloved, let us not lay it aſide, untill we can finde a better; and that we ſhall never do, unleſs we can find any thing more holy than God.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, The ſecond Branch of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> is, <hi>the Profeſſion of our Faith.</hi> It ſeems, Beloved, it is not enough to hold faſt our <hi>Faith</hi> onely, but the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of it; why ſo? truly there is this in it; the <hi>profeſſion of Faith,</hi> is as neceſſary, as the <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf: mark that. See this from the mouth of that great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,</hi> I may ſay from the mouth of God himſelf, Rom. 10.9, 10. <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved; for with the heart man believeth unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> An <hi>unprofeſsed</hi> Faith hath no <hi>ſalvation</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it: you ſee, the Scripture maketh it as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our ſalvation, to profeſs our believing, as to believe. Now beloved, if it be neceſſary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and neceſſary to profeſs, its then neceſſary, to <hi>hold faſt Faith;</hi> and conſequently, as neceſſary to hold faſt the profeſſion thereof: without Faith, there is no ſalvation, ſaith the Scripture; and ſaith this Scripture, without the profeſſion of this Faith,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109191:68"/>there is no ſalvation: now to ſay, I will <hi>keep faith</hi> I will only part with a little profeſſion, it is all one in Scripture, as to part with <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf; for why, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>If thou believe with thy heart, and confeſs with thy mouth, thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> ſo that as long as <hi>Faith</hi> continues, <hi>profeſſion</hi> is to continue, or there is no ſalvation: Faith without profeſſion, will do no more for you, then profeſſion without faith: therefore obſerve whit the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, Heb. 3.14. Saith he, <hi>We are made partakers of Chriſt, if we hold the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end:</hi> not elſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A third <hi>Argument</hi> is drawn from the act with the qualifications, <hi>let's hold faſt without wavering:</hi> Now there are two things, to name no more, that are hugely obliging in this very act, with its qualifications: Firſt, it is a manly Act, to hold faſt that which is good; and it is a childiſh act, to let it go. I ſay, it is a manly act; it argues ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a great Soul, and of a great Underſtanding, and of a manly reſolution, to hold faſt that which is good, but it is childiſh to let it go; and therefore, ſet how the Apoſtle puts theſe two together, Epheſ. 4.13, 14. ſaith he, ſpeaking there, <hi>That God had given ſome Prophets, ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Miniſtry, for the ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt;</hi> Now he comes in the 14 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Verſe, to add, <hi>That we heaceforth be no more Childre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:109191:68"/>toſsed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the ſlight of men, and canning craftineſs, whereas they lie in wait to deceive:</hi> it is not for a man to be toſſed to and fro with every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for a Child to be bought out of a Pearl, with a bawble, is no great matter; but for a man, what a ſhame is it, why we ſhould be men, not Children toſſed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine: now beloved, you know the Scripture calls upon us in ſuch Language as this, <hi>Be couragious, and quit your ſelves like men, be not like Children, that will dance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every Pipe, toſſed to and fro, and alwayes unſtable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is not only a manly act, to hold faſt that which is good and childiſh, to let it go; but it is, a Chriſtian act, a proper Chriſtian act, a right Chriſtian act, it is that which doth diſtinguiſh a true Chriſtian from a Hypocrite and a Counterfeit, you know it is a Character of a godly man, he is a <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, there went up two men into the Temple to pray, the one was a Hypocrite, the other a Publican:</hi> now what is there then in prayer, that doth diſtinguiſh theſe two men: why ſaith <hi>Job, Will the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite pray alwayes?</hi> no not he. I will warrant you, that is well, he held out in the profeſſion of God, and of his Worſhip and ſervice: the Saints are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſaid to pray; but as for the Hypocrite, <hi>will he pray alwayes?</hi> no not he; for here the true Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, they will hold faſt; but <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>Formalists,</hi> they will let go. Now mark here, the Apoſtle makes this diſtinction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and the laſt Verſe; <hi>But we are not of them who draw back to perdition but of them that believe to the ſaving
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109191:69"/>of their Souls:</hi> that is of them that believe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> end; for the end of our Faith is the ſalvation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Souls: now pray you, mark by the way, what you draw back to: when you draw back, you draw back to perdition: they that go backward, go to Hell. Now ſaith he, We are not of them that draw back to perdition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of their Souls: that is, of thoſe that believe to the end; and this is the difference he makes between them that are the people of God, and them that are not, that the end holds faſt the other, let us go thus, I have given you an accompt of the Arguments that are couched in theſe words drawn from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the object and the Act, with its qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I think, I promiſed you a few helps, with which I ſhall conclude, take them in theſe three or four particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Would you hold faſt (I cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be all your deſires) well then, if you would hold faſt, let me beſeech this of you, take heed of all, and every ſort of men, that make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion a Trade to get money, by which, perhaps you will ſay, are there any ſuch in the World? oh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Began this Scripture the laſt Lord's-Day in this Congregation. I told you then, there were three Doctrines obvious in the Text: The firſt was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. <hi>That it is the Duty of Christians, To Remember thoſe Truths that they have heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:109191:73"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That it is the Duty of Chriſtians, to <hi>hold faſt the Truths, that they have heard and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. That <hi>continued Repentance,</hi> is the Duty of Chriſtians, as well as <hi>initial Repentance. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therefore how thou hast received, and heard, and hold faſt, and repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Doctrines, I applyed my ſelf to, and applyed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he People the laſt Lord's-Day, and ſhall not now ſay any thing of it; but proceed to the next Doctrine, That it is the Duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>To hold faſt the Truths, that they have heard and received.</hi> That which the Apoſtle enjoyns on <hi>Timothy,</hi> is, in proportion the duty of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Hold faſt the form of ſound words, which thou haſt heard of me in faith, and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The whole intire Body of Divine Truth. Hold it faſt, againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever. Now if they that are themſelves Teachers of the Truth to others, muſt hold faſt the Truth, according to the Plat-form that hath been delivered to them; then much more is this the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of private Chriſtians, who are ſuppoſed, not to have that latitude of parts and gifts that Teachers have: And therefore you ſhall find, that Chriſt requires this, not onely of the Paſtors, but of the Members of his Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. ſpeaking not onely to the Angel, but to the Body of the Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:109191:73"/>all I require of you my People, keep your ſelves, and hold faſt that which you have till I come. And ſo in the 3d of <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>Behold, I come quickly, hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take away thy Crown.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, That Divine Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, that thou haſt heard and received, it is thy Crown, thy excellency, therefore hold it faſt. This Duty of holding faſt the Truth, is urged in many other places of Scripture, under other expreſſions; as that of continuing in the Word of God. Chriſt ſays, If ye continue in my Word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed. And continuing in the Faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> viſiting the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, exhor ed them to continue in the Faith. And ſo thoſe terms, of being rooted in the Truth, of ſtanding, and ſtanding faſt, and many others, they all inforce this Duty. Now for the better hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this Point, I ſhall do theſe four things;
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, I will ſhew you, What Chriſtians are to hold faſt.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, How they are to hold this faſt.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, Why they are to hold faſt that they have heard and received.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, I will apply it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, What Chriſtians are to hold faſt: The Doctrine ſays, <hi>They are to hold faſt the Truths they have received.</hi> Now Truths are of two ſorts:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some are Natural and Moral.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some are Supernatural and Divine Truths: Called Truths of God; becauſe they come from God, and conform the Mind and Soul, that receive them, to the Image of God.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:109191:74"/>
            <p>Now, though it is true, it is good for a man to be right in Moral things, and to know, and cleave to that which is Truth in Morality; yet the Truths that we are here called upon to hold faſt, they are Divine Truths, Supernatural Truths, Truths in Religion, Truths in the things of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Again, Religious and Divine Truths, Truths of God; they are, either ſuch as are ſo in name, and in the eſtimation of ſome men; or elſe they are ſuch Truths, as are Truths of God, in the truth and reality of the thing: Now, when I ſay, that Chriſtians are to hold faſt the Truths they have received, the meaning is not, that what ever any man, or company of men, offer as Truths, ſhould be received, and held faſt; for then we muſt hold faſt many Errours: But what ever men call Truth, or offer as Truth, we muſt examine it by the un-erring Rule of Truth, that is, the Word of God: In theſe things, it is a clear Canon, which we have, 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi> Prove them by the Word of God, and if they hold Truth by that, then receive them, and hold them faſt. Divine Scripture-Truths we are to hold faſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Scripture-Truths, Truths that are grounded and warranted in the Word of God, they are either ſuch as are immediately and expreſly laid down in Scripture, or ſuch as are mediately contained in Scripture, and by deduction drawn thence. Now thoſe Truths, that are immediately and expreſly laid down in Scripture, we are with out diſpute, to receive and hold faſt. But thoſe Truths, that are drawn thence, we may make uſe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109191:74"/>of our Reaſon to examine them by the Word; and ſo far as we ſee them to be drawn from Scripture, we are to receive them, and hold them faſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Divine Truths from Scripture, are of two ſorts: Either the great and weighty things of the Truth of God, and of Religion, which we call Fundamental Truths; or elſe they are thoſe things that are of leſs weight in Religion, and yet Truths of God. Now we are not onely to hold faſt thoſe Truths of God, that are the Fundamental Truths; as, That there is a God, and but one God; and, That there is a Trinity of Perſons, in Unity of Eſſence, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; and that there is but one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus; and that He is both God and Man in one Perſon, and that he hath given full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Divine Juſtice, for all that by Faith cloſe with him, and the like.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the great Points in Religion; theſe we muſt be ſure to hold faſt. And not onely theſe, but even the leſſer: Thoſe Truths of Religion, that comparatively, are, far leſs then theſe, we muſt hold them faſt. You know what our Saviour ſays of the Commands: There are ſome that are the firſt and great Commandements; and there are others, that are the leſſer: But whoſoever ſhall break one of the leaſt of God's Commandements, and ſhall teach men ſo, the ſame ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdom of God. So, whoſoever ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the leaſt Truth, God will be eaven with him for it. For thoſe Truths of God, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and ſmall, comparatively, they may be of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109191:75"/>great weight and conſequence in their Sphere. <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let Heaven run together as a Scrowl, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then one Filing of Truth ſhould be parted with</hi> Surely, thoſe Servants of God, the Martyrs, were not ſo prodigal of their lives; but knew what they did, when they ſuffered for ſuch Truths, as men now call Trifles, and not worth ſtanding for; the leaſt Truths of God muſt be held faſt.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, What we muſt hold faſt; Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Truths, Scripture-Truths, whether greater, or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; we muſt hold faſt, what we have received. I ſhould, but that I fore-ſee the time will prevent me, anſwer an Objection. Is there nothing to be held faſt but Truth? Doth not the Apoſtle bid the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> in the ſecond of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> the ſecond Chapter, and the fifteenth Verſe, <hi>Hold the Traditions which ye have been taught, whether by Word, or our Epistle?</hi> The Papiſts make much of this, Place for their unwritten Traditions. In a word, know this; Though there were ſome Doctrines of Faith, and Matters of Practice, which, when <hi>Paul</hi> writ this Epiſtle, were not expreſly to be found in Writing, that had been Preached by the Apoſtles; yet this will not, in the leaſt, infer, that now, when the Canon of Scripture is compleated, there ſhould be ſuch unwritten Traditions, to which we are to give up our Faith.</p>
            <p>I go on to the ſecond thing; and that is to ſhew, How we muſt <hi>hold faſt the Truths of God, that we have heard and received.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="143" facs="tcp:109191:75"/>
            <p>Firſt, In our Judgments, being fully reſolved, and ſettled in our Judgments concerning them, not wavering about them, nor ſuffering our ſelves by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny means and ways, to be removed from our ſtedfaſtneſs in them. Says the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Seeing you know theſe things, beware lest you alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led away with the errour of the Wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs.</hi> Take heed you be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in your Judgments; Hold faſt what you have received, and ſuffer not every Wind to blow you off from them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt hold faſt the Truths we have heard and received in our Wills, and Affections, in our love to the Truth; we muſt receive the Truth in the love of it, or elſe we ſhall never keep the Truth; Love is the ſtrongeſt hold-faſt in the World, no man will part with that which he loves: What makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he covetous man ſo unwilling to part with his Money, but becauſe he loves it? What makes the luſtful ſinner ſo unwilling to part with his Luſt, he will part with Heaven, rather then with his Luſt? Why, it is becauſe he doth ſo love it. If men did love the Truth, they would hold it faſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You muſt hold faſt the Truth, in the Profeſſion of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Let us hold faſt the Profeſſion of the Truth, or of the Faith, without wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi> We muſt not onely believe with the Heart, but confeſs with the Mouth, if we would be ſaved: When <hi>Teter</hi> denyed his Maſter with his Mouth,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:109191:76"/>and ſaid, <hi>I know him not.</hi> I am perſwaded, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him not in his heart. It is a dangerous thing in words, or outward Profeſſion, to renounce the Truth, or any part of it. <hi>Hold faſt the Profeſsion of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, We muſt hold the Truths of God faſt, in our Life and Converſation; this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls, <hi>Walking in Chriſt;</hi> and holding forth the Word of Life, in a blameleſs and harmleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>We muſt hold faſt the Truth of God in our Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, We muſt do all this Conſtantly; Hold faſt the Truth in our Judgment, and Affection, and Profeſſion, and Converſation, conſtantly, and at all times; as <hi>David, I have inclined my heart to perform thy Statutes always, even unto the end:</hi> We muſt not onely in times of calmneſs and ſerenity, when we may have all the peace, and applauſe of the World, hold faſt the Truth and Profeſſion of it; but in ſtormy Times, when Truth may burn a man's fingers, if he hold it; yet even then we muſt hold it faſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, We muſt hold faſt the Truths we have received Reſolutely, againſt all oppoſition whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether of Friends, or Foes. <hi>Paul</hi> would not bate an inch; no, not to <hi>Peter</hi> his Brother, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> elder Brother in Chriſt, and in the work of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; he reſiſted him to the face, and gave not place to him, no, not for an hour.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:109191:76"/>
            <p>Thus ſhould we hold faſt the Truth, that we have heard and received in our Judgment, in our Will, and Affections, in our Profeſſion, and in our Lives and Converſations. And thus hold them faſt conſtantly, and reſolutely, againſt all oppoſition, on the right hand, and on the left, both of Friends, and Foes; and that for theſe Reaſons, which is the firſt thing I have to do; which is to ſhew you, Why we ſhould <hi>hold faſt the Truths of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, For the excellency of Divine Truth; it is more precious then Gold, better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen Rubies, and all that you can deſire, cannot be compared with Truth. And it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe it is the immediate Iſſue of God himſelf, who is the <hi>Fountain of Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Fountain of all Perfection and Glory.</hi> Natural men have ſaid, <hi>Truth is the Daughter of Time.</hi> Divines ſay, <hi>Truth is the Daughter of God:</hi> Divine Truth is the Child of God, the Iſſue and Birth of God. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore, God hath pleaſed to deliver his Truth unto, they muſt be tenderly careful, that it be not deflowred and violated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is our duty, to hold faſt the Truth that we have received; becauſe we have received it under the notion of thoſe things, that have a kind of conſtancy in them. I ſay, we have received the Truth, under the nature of thoſe things, that have a kind of conſtancy, and perpetuity in them. The Scripture ſpeaks of the Truths of God, as an Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; <hi>Thy Teſtimonies have I taken for mine Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> in the 119. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Though a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:109191:77"/>man's Perſonal Eſtate may be alienated; yet that which is his Heritage, this is unalienable in Law, it is a wrong done to his Poſterity, if he parts with tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: Truth is the Inheritance of the Saints, therefore they are to hold it faſt. Again, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Truth of God is called a thing committed to a man's Truſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Ghoſt, which dwelleth in us.</hi> That good thing! What was that? Why, the <hi>form of ſound words;</hi> which, in the Verſe before, he had bidden him <hi>hold faſt:</hi> this is but a Reduplication of the ſame thing on him. The Body of Goſpel-Truths, that was committed to thee, <hi>hold it faſt;</hi> that good thing, a good thing: the Author of it is good, and it makes us good; all that is contained in it, is good Matter, and it tend to a good End, the ſaving of our Souls. This, ſaith he, hath been committed to thee, therefore keen it. A thing committed to a man's Truſt, muſt be ſo kept, that it may be re-delivered, and re-delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red intire and whole, and re-delivered to the ſame Perſon that did commit it to us, elſe we cannot be faithful to our truſt. The Truth of God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our truſt; we muſt ſo keep it, that we may re-deliver it, and re-deliver it intire and whole; and re-deliver it thus intire and whole to him that committed it to us, even to God.

We have but one Goſpel, and it was delivered but once: God means no more to deliver his Goſpel, and the Truths of it; therfore you had need ſtrive hard, to keep them, and hold them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſhould hold faſt the Truth that we have received; becauſe if we do not hold it faſt, we do wrong God, and we wrong our ſelves, and we wrong the Truth, and we wrong our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is our duty, <hi>to hold faſt the Truths we have received;</hi> becauſe, if we do not, we wrong God; for Truths are more Gods, then ours: They are ours, as to the uſe of them; but they are his, as he is the Original and Author of them. Truths are God's Jewels; there is never a Truth of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but God owns it as his; and for us to barter away any of theſe Truths of God, it is Sacriledge, it is a robbing of God, it is a wrong to God. This is that God complains of, by his Prophet, in the ſecond of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the eleventh and twelfth Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which are yet no Gods; but my People have changed their glory, for that which doth not profit. Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord.</hi> The Prophet, indeed, ſpeaks of a total forſaking of God, and all his Truths; but there is, in the forſaking of every Truth, a proportion of wrong to God.</p>
            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:109191:78"/>
            <p n="2">2. It is a wrong done to the Truths of God, when men having received the Truth, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, hold it not faſt, but caſt it off, this is a wrong to the Truths of God. We ſay, it is leſs reproach to a man when he comes to my houſe, to ſhut the Door againſt him, and not receive him in at all, then when he hath been in a while with me, I turn him out, all the World will now think I find cauſe to be weary of him. They who have ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="3">3. This is an injury and wrong to our ſelves; this is a wrong to our Credit and Reputation. Now, though we may not make Credit our End in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; yet we may make uſe of our Credit or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, as an Argument to hold faſt the Truth: and this is injurious to our own Souls, <hi>John</hi> 8.31. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

You can never be ſaved, unleſs you be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Diſciples of Chriſt; and you can never approve your ſelves to be the Diſciples of Chriſt indeed, if ye continue not in the Truth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Let that therefore abide in you, which you have received and heard from the beginning,</hi> If that which ye have heard from the beginning, ſhall remain in you, ye ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Hold faſt the Truth of God, which you have received, then ſhall you continue in the Son: If the Truth of God, which you have received and believed, remain in you, and be held faſt by you, ye ſhall continue in the love of the Father and Son, but not elſe; according to what he expreſſeth again; <hi>Whoſoever transgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God, therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved; he that abideth in the Doctrine hath the Father and the Son.</hi> Therefore, as you would be ſaved, hold faſt the Truths you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Now here (but I have not time to ſpeak to it) is a Caſe of Conſcience; Whether every errour doth cut a man off from God? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> No, God forbid: But this we cannot ſpeak to now.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They that hold not faſt the Truth of God, are injurious to their Poſterity. Our Fore-Fathers holding faſt the Truth of God, in the day of their Trial, and ſealing it with their Bloud, was

If a time of Tryal come, unleſs Chriſt be his Bottom and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, unleſs Chriſt be his ſtrength: if a man ſtands upon his own legs, his own Parts and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to argue and diſpute, and repel Objections, alas, theſe things will fall in a day of Tryal. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Death, and a Stake, are ſuch Arguments, Brethren, that all the Learning and Parts in the World cannot anſwer, but onely Chriſt, and his Spirit, and Grace in the Heart. Therefore, if you would hold faſt the Truths, which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and heard, and not be beaten off from them in the day of Tryal, get into Chriſt, rooted, and eſtabliſhed in him, then ſhall you ſtand, not elſe.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:109191:81"/>
               <p n="2">2. If you would hold faſt the truths that you have heard, and received, then take nothing upon truſt, in matters of Religion; what ever Preachers you hear, or what ever Books you read, take not things upon truſt, but examine them, and prove them by the Scriptures, and judge what foundation and warrant they have from the Scriptures, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly receive them, or receive them not. It is obſervable in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. When the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Deſpiſe not Propheſyings,</hi> in the next words he ſayes, <hi>Prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Though I would not have you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Propheſying, and Preachers, yet I would not have you to take things upon truſt, in matters of Religion, <hi>but prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If you would be able to hold faſt the truths that you have heard, and received, get a clear and diſtinct, and certain knowledge of what is truth, that which you would hold faſt, get a clear aſſured knowledge, that it is the truth of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Continue thou in the things which thou haſt learned, and haſt been aſsured of;</hi> if a man would continue in the things that he hath learned, he muſt be aſſured of them, that they are the truths of God: But how ſhall a man be aſſured, that ſuch and ſuch things are the truths of God? He may know this; firſt, by the conſonancy of them to the word of God; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the power of them on his own heart, to convince, or humble, and quicken it.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:109191:82"/>
               <p n="4">4. If you would be inabled to hold faſt the truths you have heard, and received, then get a high valuation and eſteem of the truths of God. Such as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.12. <hi>The Law of thy mouth is better unto me, then thouſands of Gold and Silver.</hi> Better in it ſelf; all the Gold and Silver in the world, all the riches in the world, will never do a man ſo much good as that; and better in my eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I value it more, I had rather part with all, then with the Word; A man that is of this mind, he will hold faſt the truth: Oh that there were ſuch a heart in every one of you! as to ſay, <hi>The words of Gods mouth, they are better then Eſtate, and better then liberty, and better then Wife and Children:</hi> if there were ſuch a heart in us, this would inable us to hold faſt the truths of God, and part with all, rather then them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you would hold faſt the truth, that you have received and heard, then make conſcience to practice according to what you know; make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obey the truths of God, obedience is the ſinue of conſtancy, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.44. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever heares theſe Sayings of mine, and doth them, he is like a man which built his Houſe, and digged deep, and laid the foundation upon a Rock; and when the flood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and the ſtreams beat vehemently upon that Houſe, it could not ſhake it.</hi> Mark ye, it could not be ſhaken: the conſcionable practical hearer, and receiver of the truth of God, he is the man that is like to hold out, and to hold faſt the Word; he that hath been a careleſs hearer, and never made conſcience to hear for obedience, and practice, he is blown over
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:109191:82"/>preſently; it is a ſad paſſage I have met with in that Reverend man, Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> and to me it ſeems to have much weight in it; What hopes, ſayes he, can we have of many of our hearers in <hi>England,</hi> who are willing to give the World a hearing, and outwardly profeſs it; but what hope can we have, but that if a time of triall come, they will turn Papiſts, or profain, or any thing? for they never loved the Word, when they heard it; and they never obeyed the Word, but lived in known ſins; they take up a form of godlineſs, and hate the power of it; what hope, but that if a time of tryal come, theſe will fall from the truths.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you would be able to hold faſt the truth that you have heard, and received; then take heed of receiving the leaſt truth of God, take heed I ſay, of knowing and willing, forſaking the leaſt truth; and knowing and willing, giving way to the leaſt errour, as the committing of the leaſt ſin, may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man abominable unto God, as you find in <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.43. <hi>You ſhall not make your ſelves abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable with any creeping thing;</hi> that is, with the eating of any creeping thing. Now this was one of the leaſt Commandements that God gave out, for the not eating of ſuch and ſuch things; and yet by tranſgreſſing this, the people might make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abominable: the committing of the leaſt ſin may make a man abominable to God; ſo the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of the leaſt errour, and the forſaking of the leaſt truth, may make a man abominable to God: the leaſt truth forſaken knowingly, and the leaſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour imbraced knowingly, becomes a great ſin; and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109191:83"/>a little errour, makes way for a greater, if once a man gives way to one errour, a thouſand will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after. If we would hold faſt the whole body of truth, we muſt take heed we forſake not the leaſt truth, if we forſake God and his truths, whether in leſſer matters or greater; and if we turn back again to Popery, and conform to the Papiſts in leſſer matters (ſaith Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi>) know of a certainty, that Popery ſhall return again.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If you would hold faſt the truths you have heard, and received, then ſhun all ſuch perſons as would go about to draw you off from the truth of God; ſhun all Seducers, confer not with them; have nothing to do with them, and their wayes. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Ceaſe my Son, to hear the instruction that cauſeth to erre from the words of knowledge;</hi> thou haſt been inſtructed in the words of knowledge; and if any would inſtruct thee otherwiſe, and ſeek to draw thee off from the words of truth, and knowledge, have nothing to do with them: <hi>Ceaſe my Son to hear the Instruction that cauſeth to erre from the words of knowledge.</hi> Now my Brethren, this advice I judge to be the more ſeaſonable, becauſe it is in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that this preſent providence of God, in taking off at one ſtroak, ſo many of his Servants (that have indeavoured in uprightneſs of heart to inſtruct you, and the People of God, from this work), it is on my heart to think and fear, this will give a great advantage to Seducers, to ſeek to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you, and draw you off from the truth to their party; When the Shepheards are ſmitten, there is a great opportunity given to the Foxes, and Wolves,

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109191:84"/>Death-bed: the ſame I ſhall ſpeak to you now, through Gods aſſiſtance; and firſt, I would, and in ſome meaſure do give thanks to God, the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh; that hath called me a poor unworthy Creature, not onely to the knowledge, but to the preaching of the Goſpel of his Son Jeſus Chriſt; and that in this place, and in this part of the Land; and hath pleaſed in mercy to continue life and liberty to me in my work here, almoſt 26. years. Secondly, I would be, and <hi>I</hi> hope I am in ſome meaſure, thankful to God, and to his people, both of this Town, and of the Neighbour-hood, for a great deal of love and reſpect, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they have given to my Perſon and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry here; and particularly, I do acknowledge my ſelf to be greatly obliged to my Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the neighbour-Miniſters, for the much love I have received from them, their readines to help me, in ſupplying my place in the time of my ſickneſs, or abſence; and ſweet ſociety I have had with them, I believe you think it is no eaſie thing for me to ſpeak, or think of parting with ſuch an Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Society: the like to which, I never look to have on Earth again. But ſeeing, for my ſins, and your ſins, God will have it ſo, we muſt ſubmit, and lye at his feet: that which he hath made crooked who can make ſtraight? But before we part, give me leave to ſpeak a few words to you, ſomething by way of Requeſt, and ſomething by way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: by way of Requeſt, I would ſpeak this.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:109191:84"/>
               <p>Firſt, That if any of you have found any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by my poor Miniſtry, that if any of you have been inlightened, or awakened, or ſtrengthened, and built up in the truth, and incouraged in the wayes of holineſs, by any thing that God hath put into my mouth to ſpeak to you, let God have the prayſe, and let me have ſome room in your hearts and prayers, however God ſhall deal with me.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Requeſt is, That wherein ſoever you have ſeen any failings in me, or any failings in my Miniſteriall duty, that you would pleaſe to paſſe it by, and to help me in Prayer to God, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of them: Theſe are my Requeſts of you, and that which I have to ſay to you, by way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is much the ſame, with what I ſaid to this particular. Congregation the laſt Lords day. Take it in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I would adviſe you, and intreat you, that we may all of us lay to heart, this preſent Diſpenſation of God towards us, and the Nation, in this reſpect, that we may be ſenſible of it. I remember, when I was young, and my famous Predeceſſor, Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> was taken off from his Miniſtry in this kinde, though but for a few weeks, theſe parts were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſenſible of that Providence, and laid it to heart; and were much in Humiliation, and in Prayer; and I think, I may ſay, they received an anſwer again within ſome weeks. Now Brethren, though he was worth ſome hundreds of us; yet now it is not the laying by of one man, but of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, fifty in one place, and threeſcore in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109191:85"/>and fourſcore in another, and this not by a ſingle Biſhop, but by an Act of Parliament, which makes the wound the wider, and the more unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of cure; and ſhall we not be ſenſible of this? Shall ſo many pretious veſſels be laid by, as veſſels of no pleaſure and none take it to heart? Shall ſo many burning lights be quenched together, ſo many wells of the Water of life be ſtopt up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and this not be laid to heart? I beſeech you conſider and be ſenſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the deepeſt, and ſaddeſt ſence you have of this Providence of God; watch over your own ſpirits, that you lay the blame of it no where ſo much, as upon your ſelves; blame none ſo much for this, as your ſelves. Some blame the times and charge it on their iniqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies; others are apt to blame us Miniſters, and charg it on our niceneſſe and ſingularity. Might my Advice take place with this people, I would deſire, that every one of us might lay the blame no where ſo much, as on our ſelves, For certainly, we have procured theſe things to our ſelves. I find our Predeceſſors, the Martyrs, when by a Law Religion was changed in the Nation, and Idollatry ſet up, they laid the blame not on the Law-makers, but on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own hearts. One of them ſaith, All this is come upon us, becauſe we did not live the Goſpell; we were Goſpellers in lip, but not in life: Much more doth it become us, whoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are farre leſſe, to blame our ſelves more, then we blame any others.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:109191:85"/>
               <p n="3">3. My third Aduice is this, and I beſeech you take it in love, for it is out of love that it is given you; if you ſhould perceive at this time, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernce in opinion and practice among us, that are the Miniſters of the Goſpell in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſtanding, and ſticking, at things that others can digeſt, and doe; and others doing things, that ſome of their Brethren cannot come up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Be not offended, thus it hath alwayes been from the beginning, it is no new thing. Thus it was in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes. If, there be any of God's Servants that are Learned, and Holy, and Faithfull, that do now for the enjoyment of their Miniſtry, yield a conformity, to all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. I doubt not, but many of them are grieved, that they cannot have the exerciſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry without this: and we who cannot come up to this, are grieved, that we cannot come up to it; the one, and the other, have griefe enough; adde not your cenſures to this griefe, that is already upon them. It hath been all along, a Mercifull Providence of God, that when ſome of his ſervants could not ſatisfy their conſciences, and come up to the things that have been impoſed upon them, without injuring their Conſciences; yet others have had a greater freedom given them, that they could yeild; and if not ſo, What would have become of the people of God? Therefore, in thoſe things, acknowledg there may be ſome providence of God, for good to you in it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. My fourth Advice, I ſhall deliver to you wholly, in the words of that Holy man and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr

                  </gap>ties, at leaſt, ſome of them are taken from ſome of us, from many of us, for a time. My Advice and Counſell is, that the leſſe now you hear, the more you would read; read the word of God much the mote, and take all helps for the right underſtanding of what you read. The Book of Annotations is a great help to inlighten you to underſtand the Scriptures; and next to the reading of the Scriptures, what ſpare houres you have, I would adviſe you to beſtow your time in teading of the Book of Martyrs, a Book that hath formerly been more prized, then of late in <hi>England.</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:109191:86"/>read that part of it which containes the Hiſtory of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes; they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you, of the great controverſies that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and the Papiſts; and they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you, what you ſhall anſwer; the reading how chearfully they went to Priſon, and to the ſtake will embolden you againſt the feares of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and death; and the reading of their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will be a great meanes to edifie, and build you up; this reading of the Scriptures, and other good Books is my fifth Advice to you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. My ſixth Advice to you is, That ſeeing God hath taken away your Week-dayes opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of hearing the Word, here, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you would be careful, that the World may not devoure Gods Portion, I mean that portion of time, which ſome of you have beſtowed on hearing theſe Lectures: It was a good Speech of a gracious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man now with God, when Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> was ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: <hi>Well,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>By the Grace of God, The World ſhall never have thoſe houres, that I was wont to ſpend in hearing heretofore:</hi> her meaning was, ſhe would ſpend them in her Cloſet in holy duties.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109191:87"/>or elſe in praying in, and with your Families, and inſtructing of them: if <hi>I</hi> might but obtain this of you at my parting, <hi>I</hi> ſhould believe, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and his Kingdom would be looſers, by this out parting, if you would ſpend this time weekly in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſes, reading and praying for your ſelves, and for the Nation, and for your Families, which you were wont to ſpend in coming to theſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and in attending here, and returning home; and that is my ſixth Advice to you, and herefore let me intreat this of you.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And my ſeventh Advice and Counſel is this, that ſeeing it pleaſeth God to take away from you, ſo many of your publick Inſtructors, that you would every one of you that are heads of Families, be ſo much the more in inſtructing, and teaching your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: Be ſo much the more in this, by how much the leſſe is done in publick.

And now Brethren, <hi>I</hi> commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace; which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are ſanctified.</p>

               </gap>. <hi>That the peoples eyes muſt be taught by the Miniſters holineſs of life, as well as their ears by the Miniſters ſoundneſs of Doctrine.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> did not reach one thing and practice another; he practiſed as he preached, and he both practiſed and preached the forementioned Duties in the Verſe before the Text. And to this end the Lord appointed a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to be perpetuated through all ages of the World: And it is the Lords appointment that peoples ears ſhould be taught by the Miniſters holineſs of life, as well as their ears by their ſoundneſs in Doctrine; and this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Miniſter himſelf, and neceſſary for the, people: No marvel then that a faithful Miniſtry is the Butt of the Devils malice, or his craft and cruelty, and that the Devil hath in all Ages attempted and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured utterly to overthrow the Miniſtry, or topoyſon and fly-blow it ſhamefully; and this is the method where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Satan hath endeavoured to fly-blow the Miniſtry Why then ſee the folly and madneſs of thoſe people who affect or cry up thoſe Miniſters who do not reach their people with ſound Doctrine, or a holy life; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not ſuch Miniſters which do not teach their

               </gap> people are not guilty of ſpiritual folly and madneſs? judge ye.</p>
            <p>Doct. 2. A Miniſters ſoundneſs in Doctrine and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life and converſation, doth lay a very great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation on a people to a due conſcientious practice of every commanded duty. The Apoſtle, we ſee, maketh his Preaching and Practice an argument to excite the <hi>Philippians</hi> to the fore-mentioned commanded duties, as is in the Text, and the verſe before the Text.</p>
            <p>As firſt of all, the Appellations and Titles given in Scripture to ſuch Miniſters whoſe Doctrine is ſound, and whoſe Lives and Converſations are exemplarily holy.</p>
            <p>They are called, 1. <hi>The ſalt of the Earth,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.13. read that, ſaith Chriſt to thoſe great Teachers of the Goſpel, and Diſpenſers of his Oracles, and in them to their Succeſſours. Salt hath two things in it, namely, Sharpneſs and Savourineſs; and thus Miniſters, firſt muſt rebuke ſharply, that people may be ſown in the Faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyns <hi>Titus,</hi> as in the 1. of <hi>Titus</hi> and 13. verſe. And ſecondly, Miniſters muſt ſpeak ſavoury things to every perſon, and to every palate, that their people may be ſavoury both in heart and life; but to be as unfavoury as ſtinking carion in the noſtrils of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, under ſuch a ſavoury and ſeaſoning Miniſtry, this is woful. It is the nature of ſalt to cauſe barrenneſs where it ſeaſoneth not, therefore we read of <hi>Abimel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> their caſe is very dangerous.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:109191:89"/>
            <p n="2">2. They are called again <hi>the Light of the World,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14. read that. As for their Doctrine, <hi>the Salt of the Earth;</hi> ſo for their Lives, <hi>the Light of the World;</hi> and they muſt therefore lead convincing lives, as <hi>John</hi> 5.35. read that; it is there ſaid of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, our bleſſed Lord and Saviour gives him this commendatory Character, or Teſtimonial, <hi>That be was a burning and a ſhining light,</hi> burning in himſelf, and ſhining to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Or as it was ſaid of <hi>Baſil, Thundring in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and lightning in his Life and Converſation.</hi> Now if good Miniſters be the light of the world, then hence we may infer,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Inf.</hi> 1. That without a godly faithful Miniſtry the world lyeth in darkneſs, ignorance, errour, ſin and miſery. It is ſaid of <hi>Galilee,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.16. <hi>That the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> who ſate in darkneſe, ſaw great light,</hi> read that. Why, had they not Prieſts and Levites? I anſwer, they had indeed ſorr, Prieſts, but they had not a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; and therefore the Evangeliſts rells them <hi>they ſate in darkneſs,</hi> yea, <hi>in the region and ſhadow of death,</hi> notwiſhſtanding the ſorry ſottiſh Prieſts they had, But, when they had a faithful Miniſtry, they are ſaid to ſee a great Light. Again, If good Miniſters be the light of the world, then we may draw this Corollary, That to be offended at the light of a faithful and powerful, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, argues and ſpeaks a very ſinful and wretched frame of heart. Nothing is to excellent, but ſome will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at and with it, as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.7. Even the light it ſelf we know is offenſive to ſore eyes; and this the burning and ſhining light of a godly and faithful Miniſtry is offenſive and terrible to ſome; but who are they? fore diſeaſed ſouls, the Lord knows. The Ark of God, which was the monument of his preſence, whom did it ſmite with Emrods but the <hi>Philiſtinet?</hi> What then, is the Ale-bench more eaſie to thee than thy Pew is to thee in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109191:90"/>this place? than a Conſcience, Soul-ſearching Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? what, art thou offended at a powerful faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry? Oh fearful plague-tokens!</p>
            <p n="3">3. To do all that man can do to put out the Light, this is worſe. It is the moſt horrid, helliſh plot, that can be aſſigned or named; and of this I am ſure the the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot plead not guilty, which like the Scribes and Phariſees, take away from the people the key of knowledge, and ſhut up the Kingdome of Heaven againſt men. How terribly doth our bleſſed Lord thunder-ſtrike thoſe ſtupid Phariſees for this? <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13. And as did the Phariſees, ſo did the Papiſts: For 1. Heretofore they made it a mortal ſin to read Gods word. 2. Afterwards they clogged the liberty they granted with ſuch cautions and reſtrictions, as tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the Inquiſition. 3. Thoſe clogs contented not, but now it is thought fit utterly to deny liberty, and can there be a more horrible helliſh plot aſſigned than this, to take from people their knowledge of ſalvation? And thus the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether they have Church-ſnuffers or not, to be ſure they have Church extinguiſhers, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious means to put out the light. Oh fearful is this! as in <hi>John</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>That is the reaſon men hate the Light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If good Miniſters be the Light of the world, then hence may we draw this concluſion, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns people very nearly to believe in the light, and-to walk in the light, and to work while the light laſteth, at our bleſſed Saviour exhorteth in <hi>John</hi> 12, 35, 36. read that. God ſets up his Miniſters as Lights, as Candles on the candleſticks of his Church, to awaken men, and to light men unto eternal life: And ought not people to pray hard, and work hard while the light laſteth? Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> removes many times the candle and candleſtick, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109191:90"/>makes the Sun to go down at noon-day, as <hi>Amos</hi> 8.9. So darkens the earth at clear day. Good Miniſters they are called the Light of the world, and they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Stars, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.1. And who are meant by the ſeven Stars? <hi>Rev.</hi> 1 <hi>ult.</hi> they are the Angels, that is, the Miniſters of the ſeven Churches. Now the Stars are ſaid to affect thoſe inferiour bodies, 1. By their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. And thus godly and faithful Miniſters, by the influence of their lips, they feed many with the bread of life. 2. By their regular motives of their lives they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm many. 3. By the light of both they confirm many: one while their employment is to inſtruct poor ſouls, and ſo they are like Stars ſhining in a dark winter night; another while they are to converſe in their courſes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.20. Now to enjoy and live under the Miniſtry of ſuch Stars, and yet to walk in darkneſs, and to have fellowſhip with the works of darkneſſe, to remain unconvinc'd, unconverted, unhumbled, unmortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unfruitful, this is woful, this is a very lamentable ſtate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are called the Lords Meſſengers, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. And the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for indeed the Miniſters of the New Teſtament they are no where called Prieſts, they are called Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours for Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. Godly, faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are the Lords Meſſengers and Embaſſadours in matters concerning the ſoul, the precious, immortal, never dying ſoul of man, not in the matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of this life, but for the ſoul. Now this is no mean employment to treat with God for the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are called the Lords Husbandmen. Gods Church is his husbandry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. And Miniſters are Gods Husbandmen: naturally we are. like a barren wilderneſs; now the Lord ſends his Husbandmen to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:109191:91"/>thoſe barren wilderneſſes, to make it a fruitful Paradiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Well, you ſee the titles given to them in Scripture: they are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lled the Salt of the Earth, and the Light of the World, and Stars, and the Lords Meſſengers and Embaſſadours, and Husbandmen; all which doth import a very great obligation lying on a people who live under ſuch a Miniſter and who live under, and practice every commanded duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Inference.</hi> 2. Dangerous and fearful is the eſtate of thoſe who have enjoyed, and lived under, and have not been wrought upon by ſuch a Miniſtry.

Therefore may ſome ſay, It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtrange, that Chriſt ſhould thus diſgrace the Scribes and Phariſees, was not this the way to make their Miniſtry contemptible?</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is very clear and undeniable that there were a generation of pitiful ſorry Teachers, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.36. Why, did not the people enjoy the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scribes and Phariſees; yes, they did, but the Scribes and Phariſees were Idol Shepherds, they knew not how to feed their flock, and therefore Chriſt lookt on the people as ſheep ſcattered abroad for all the Scribes and Phariſees. They did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that there was heart-murder, or heart-adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, untill our bleſſed Saviour inſtructed them. The Scribes and Phariſees they did but ſtrike at the bough only, but our Saviour <hi>preached with authority, and not at the Scribes did.</hi> And withall I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That beyond all peradventure our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour ſaw that although the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees did teach ſome truths, yet by their life and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they did more miſchief then good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more credit they had among the people, the more miſchief they were like to do; and therefore from hence our bleſſed Lord and Saviour calls them <hi>a generation of vipers,</hi> But I hope you will not count it an argument of the breach of the Churches peace to ſpeak vilely of a vile Miniſtry, It was no more than <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did, and then our Saviour did.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, No mans ſin deſerves ſo ſharply to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as the ſins of Miniſters, becauſe their ſins of all others are the chief ſins committed in a land; at the Sanctuary prophaneſſe too too often begins.

The <hi>Jews</hi> there bewailed the ſins of their Magiſtrates and Miniſters, as the particular cauſe of their plagues, On the ſins of the Teachers, are the Teachers of ſin, and therefore no mans ſin deſerves to be ſo ſharply reproved, as the ſcandalous ſins of Miniſters. Now if you love your ſouls, take heed and beware of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane delight in lewd, looſe, diſſolute Miniſters. We find the Lord complaining of the wickedneſſe of the Prophets, and of the Prieſt and People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> the People did take a prophane delight in falſe Prophets, and in polluted Prieſts; and ſo likewiſe in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Micah, chap,</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. the people, although they did oppoſe the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> and other true Prophets, yet they did approve of, and delight in falſe Prophets, ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s were of their own leven, their own way and mould, ſuch as would flatter them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them wine and ſtrong drink: and are there not many ſuch people in the world, that had rather hear ſuch a Miniſter, than ſuch as preach cloſe-walking with God, and of getting to Heaven under pain of damnation?

            <p>Thirdly, take heed and beware of ſinful idolizing of godly, faithful, Miniſters; the Apoſtle decries this with much zeal, ardency and fervency of ſpirit, what is <hi>Pauls</hi> planting, and what is <hi>Apollo</hi>'s watering, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6. as excellent gifts, parts, and graces as theſe men had, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And read <hi>ver.</hi> 7. it is God, and he only that can give increaſe: as <hi>Eliſha's</hi> Servant could carry his Maſters ſtaffe and lay it on the dead child, but the Child could not be raiſed to life untill <hi>Eliſha</hi> came himſelf; thus g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dly faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can but lay Gods Meſſage before you, but unleſs the Lord ſet it to the heart, never a dead ſoul can be raiſed from the death of ſin, to the life of grace and holineſſe. Remember, godly and faithful Miniſters, although they have the Lords Sword, yet they have not the Lord Chriſts Arm; and alas what can the Lord Chriſts Sword do without his Arm?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, take heed of being leavened with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt the Miniſtry of the word, becauſe of the miſdemeanour or miſcarriage of the Miniſter. Surely the efficacy of the Word and Sacraments, doth not depend on the quality of the Miniſter. It is the word of the Lord that converts, not the perſon of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpencer or Speaker. A ſeed that is ſown in a good ſoyl, may, yea will grow and thrive, although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Sower had a very dirty hand; as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3. the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they are, ſaith he, <hi>the Epiſtle of Chriſts Miniſtry by us;</hi> the Hand is Chriſts, Miniſters are but the Pen. Hence it was, that the Miniſtry of the Scribes and Phariſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was not to be rejected, but to be eſteemed, ſo long as they failed not in the ſubſtance thereof; and hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle rejoyceth that Chriſt was preached of the falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18. though out of envy; take heed therefore and beware of a total ſeparation from, diſſerting of, and forſaking Church aſſemblies; and yet I conceive it is a very rare thing for uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109191:99"/>Miniſters to convert ſome. For what ſaith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Zephania, Zeph.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Oh ſaith the Lord, to Jeruſalem, that bath ſuch Prophets and ſuch Prieſts, woe to ſuch a City, to ſuch a Country, to ſuch a Pariſh:</hi> and what ſaith Chriſt himſelf in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Let them alone;</hi> oft times it falls out ſo, that it made Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> ſpeak in a Lecture of his, and profeſſe, that his heart did even bleed within him, to think of the precious ſouls of many people who had ſuch Miniſters, that if they had not been in the Miniſtry, they would not have been fit Hogherds f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r Swine. And yet we muſt remember not to tie the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the word and Sacraments to the goodneſſe or badneſſe of a Miniſters perſon.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, take heed and beware of being leavened with prejudice againſt all Miniſters, becauſe of the vileneſſe and monſter-like unbeſeeming carriage of ſome Miniſters. It hath been granted over and over, that ſome Miniſters evil, licentious carriage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations are notorious; the Lord knows, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſters have <hi>Eſau</hi>'s hands with <hi>Jacobs</hi> voice: what then, muſt this redound to the general diſgrace of all Miniſters: Becauſe ſome profeſſors of the Law live lawleſſe, muſt therefore all be cenſured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for lawleſſe livers? Becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and a Son of perdition, will you therefore ſay that all the Diſciples of Chriſt were naught? Perhaps you do know ſome <hi>Sir Johns,</hi> ſome blind Seers, ſome blind Watchmen, who know not Heavens way, ſome blind Droans; Or ſecondly, ſome that carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſolently, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.1, 2. as <hi>Paſher</hi> did. Or thirdly, ſome that are too too like that evil ſervant in the Goſpel, as <hi>Luke</hi> 12.45. Or perhaps you know fourthly, ſome apoſtatizing <hi>Demuſſes,</hi> who embrace this preſent world, and revolt from their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:109191:100"/>and profeſſion, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. Or perhaps yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 3 <hi>John</hi> 9. Perhaps you know ſome ſuch as theſe as I have inſtanced, what then? is there any profeſſion, as it were, but it hath a certain skum? why then in the face of ſome, who through grace are free from theſe miſcarriages, take heed and beware of being leavened with prejudice againſt all Miniſters, becauſe of the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſcarriage of ſome.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Be earneſt with the Lord for a godly, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſtry, whoſe labour and pains among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Lord uſeth to bleſſe. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the great Patron of all Livings, as a Reverend man, now in Heaven, once ſaid; He can preſent whom he will to a Pariſh, and he can reſtore whom he will to their people, as <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5.6 7. As he did <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon by the peoples prayers. And thus when <hi>Paul</hi> was in priſon at <hi>Rome,</hi> obſerve how he writes to <hi>Philemon,</hi> in <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. of his Epiſtle. And thus when the Author of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was reſtrained from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, obſerve what an Exhortation he uſeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18.19. Oh pray therefore, pray for godly faithful Miniſters, their pains, their labours, the Lord uſeth to bleſſe among a people; as <hi>Malachy</hi> 2.6 we read that the Lord bleſſed the labours of <hi>Levi,</hi> ſo that he was an Inſtrument in the Lords hand to turn wicked men from their iniquity: and <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. Lo it was ſaid of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that by his Miniſtry <hi>much people were added to the Lord. Acts</hi> 11.24. And if we would have godly faithful Miniſters, as we muſt pray for them, ſo we muſt firſt repent us of our ſins. <hi>Jer</hi> 3.14.15. Repent we muſt of our ſins, and particularly our contempt of the Ordinances and Worſhip of God, Secondly, We muſt prize the Goſpel more then we have done; the Goſpel loves to come, and to ſtay where it is welcome.

            <p n="7">7. Be earneſt with the Lord, that the refining work of a National-Reformation, a City, a Countrey, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Reformation, a Perſonal-Reformation may begin at the refining and purging of Miniſters. None will deny, but that there is great need of Reformation; there is none of you but will confeſſe, that the ſeed of leaven had need ſometimes to be winnowed out from among us, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.48. <hi>Hezektab</hi> began at the Prieſts and Levites, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> began his Reformation at them; and thus at our firſt Reformation, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants did then affirm, that there could never be any good Reformation, unleſſe they began at the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> And it is very obſervable, that when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of the Lord Chriſts coming, as a refining fire, and as Fullers ſoap, this alſo is propheſied of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the Sons of <hi>Levi, Malachy</hi> 2.2. When he ſhall purifie the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> when he ſhall purge them as gold and ſilver As it was in <hi>Judah,</hi> in that good Reign of that good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29 34. The Prieſts were too few there; And as it was in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> then, whether it be not ſo in <hi>England</hi> now, I affirm not, but leave you to judge. But a Miniſter ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Doctrine, and holineſs of life and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould lay a great obligation on a people, duly and conſcientiouſly to practice every command to duty. And this may ſuffice for the ſecond Doctrine. Come we now to the third Doctrine deducible to be handled from this Text; and that is this, <hi>That in the due pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of commanded duties, Gods people may warrantably
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:109191:101"/>and confidently expect much of the gracious preſence of the God of peace, even in the worſt of times. Theſe things think on,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Theſe things doe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in the Text; and what then? <hi>the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> In the due practice of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed duties, Gods people may confidently expect much of the gracious preſence of the God of peace in the worſt of times: Then take counſel fron this Doctrine, that you may have the gracious preſence of the God of peace with you, and if this pulpit were my death-bed, I ſhould give ſuch counſel as theſe following to you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Crown the Prince of peace, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in your hearts and lives: I ſay, Crown the Prince of peace, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in your hearts and lives, receive him as your Lord and King, ſet a Crown on his head here in your hearts and lives, and he will Crown you with peace in this life, and ſet a Crown of glory, a Crown of immortality on your heads in the life to come. If you have Chriſt, you have all things, all heavenly graces, all ſpiritual comforts, all temporal bleſſings; if you have Chriſt, God will, God can then give you all things that are good for you, without Chriſt, you are not, and you can do nothing that is acceptable with God.</p>
            <p>Therefore this is my firſt counſel to you, <hi>Crown the Prince of peace, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in your hearts and lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Then maintain a conſtant and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious intimate communion with the God of peace. It was good counſel which <hi>Eliphas</hi> gave to <hi>Job, Job</hi> 22.21. Would you have much of the preſence of the God of peace? Oh then frequently fall down, and lye at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed to be with his poor Miniſters always, even to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> If alwayes, not in the Pulpit, only; no, the Lord hath promiſed to be with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants out of the Pulpit as well as in the Pulpit; in the Priſon ſealing the truth, as well as in the Pulpit preaching the truth: Oh then, will you put this in ſuit by prayer, that the Lord Chriſt will be with his poor Miniſters to the end of the world. 2. <hi>We ſhall not ſail to pray for you,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. Our ſequeſtring from our preaching work from you, will give us advantage to lay out more time to fetch ſighs from our hearts in praying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work for you; and I truſt the Lord will give us hearts, ſo to improve our time for you, as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, ſo <hi>God forbid we ſhould ſin against the Lord in ceaſing to pray for you.</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi> did to the people with a promiſe, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. And not only for you, but</p>
            <p>Secondly, Even for ſuch as have treated us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what uncivilly and unkindly, to ſay no more of them, although the number of them are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable; but for ſuch, I truſt we ſhall not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in our prayers: As <hi>Moſes</hi> fell down on his face for the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they treated him very unkindly, and ſpit in his face, I truſt we ſhall not forget <hi>Moſes</hi>'s prayer for the people: And ſo, when they danced before their Idol, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> wept for thoſe in his time, as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 13.17. And that we ſhall not forget <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> weeping for you: And I truſt likewiſe, that we ſhall remember <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> being on his knees for his Perſecutours, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out his life and prayer together, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.60. I doubt not but my Reverend Brother, and my ſelf,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:109191:102"/>ſhall remember <hi>Pauls</hi> willingneſs, to <hi>ſpend, and to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> both in prayer and preaching for you all.</hi> Though the more abundantly he loved, the leſſe he was beloved, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Maintain and nouriſh all tenderneſs in your Conſcience all your dayes: Oh go not without, much leſſe againſt the dictates of conſcience! rebel not againſt the light of it; beware of ſtifling and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a warning conſcience, leſt a warning conſcience, prove a gnawing conſcience, and prove a tormenting conſcience: And conſider, firſt, Remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath an eye againſt all ſin paſt. Secondly, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Conſcience, which hath an eye to all ſin to come. Take heed then of all calmneſs of heart.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Take heed of Apoſtatizing. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> hath a notable ſaying, namely, <hi>That Ministers have a greater trouble, becauſe they never find their work as they leave it, as other workmen do:</hi> Oh in how ſhort a time doth a poor Miniſter find all his work put out of frame and order! Did not <hi>Moſes</hi> find it ſo? <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.8. <hi>Moſes</hi> had no ſooner turn'd his back as it were, but the people were turned out of Gods way of worſhip. And did not <hi>Paul</hi> find it ſo? <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. The <hi>Galathians</hi> were quickly removed; <hi>Paul</hi> was but lately gone from them, and they were quickly apoſtatized. Now this cometh to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is by reaſon of a crafty, ſubtil, deceitful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as in the Goſpel we read. <hi>While men ſlept, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my came and ſowed tares, Mat.</hi> 13.25. And who this Enemy is, we may ſee in Chriſts expounding the Parabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>ver.</hi> 39.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, Partly by reaſon of mens own deceit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful hearts, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. obſerve it. There is an evil heart of unbelief in the beſt: it dwells in the beſt, but it reign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, It is partly by Reaſon of deceitful workers, as the Apoſtle calls falſe Apoſtles. It is partly by reaſon of ſuch. Then take heed of apoſtatizing, either from truth of Doctrine, purity of worſhip, or practice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From truth of Doctrine. Be not weary of old truths; take beed and beware of itching after novel Doctrines; take heed and beware of admiring this or that opinion, which, as new lights, drop down from heaven, but indeed is but as the ſmoak of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From purity of Worſhip alſo. Let not your zeal be cold, but kindled againſt every bracelet of the Scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Whore. How often doth the Apoſtle call the people adulterers and adultereſſes, becauſe they apoſtatize from the Word and Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In practice and Converſation. Prize the Goſpel, love it, and live accordingly to it: With conſtancy look on every motion of thy ſoul, and every action of thy life, as a ſtep to life or a ſtep to death, as a ſtep towards Heaven, or a ſtep to Hell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. To cloſe this Counſel, the Author of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> bringeth in the Lord, proteſting againſt apoſtatizing. If any man draw back from Goſpel-principle, and Goſpel-worſhip, or froth a Goſpel-converſation, ſaith the Lord, <hi>If any man draw back thus, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then at this, thou Apoſtatizer, whoever thou art, wherever thou ſitteſt or ſtandeſt, <hi>My Son ſhall have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="5">5. All of you then ſtudy peace, and particularly you who do unfeignedly ſet your hearts and faces towards

                  </gap>ineſſe in the way that God would have him, whether it be by a way of doing, or of ſuffering. And herein I ſhewed,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The nature of the ſpiritual ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Author of it, It is God by his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Object of it, God through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The proper Subject of this inward ſpiritual comfort, the people of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, The effects of the ſpiritual comfort; it is to ſtrengthen the heart, both to do and ſuffer.</p>
               <p>I came the laſt time, to ſhew you how the Spirit of God doth this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He doth it as an enlightning Spirit, by ſhewing where comfort is to be had, by opening the eyes of the underſtanding, as he did <hi>Hagars</hi> bodily eyes, to ſee the Well of water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth it as a quickning Spirit, bringing the ſoul into that capacity to take in the comfort; for what comfort can a dead man receive? a Cordial and a Puddle is all one to a dead man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He works this inward ſpiritual ſatisfaction, by diſcovering the truth of this vitall Principle in the ſoul: for a man may have a principle of Grace and ſpiritual life in him, and not know it, that though he has the ſpiritual comfort, yet it is all one as if he had it not.</p>
               <p>Now this is the great Queſtion that is debated in the heart of a Child of God, Whether he be regener a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risfied as to this, he would not be a moment without comfort: But he is afraid that he is dead in ſin, that he is a ſtranger to the life of Grace; hence ariſeth all his ſpiritual troubles, now the Spirit of God comes in and reſolves the caſe, comes into the ſoul by his bright Reflections, and fills our ſouls with comfort: Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> which is of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Spirit of God is a comforting Spirit, as he openeth the vein of godly ſorrow in the ſoul: Truly this is the next way to ſpiritual comfort, when a man can once ſpiritually mourn for ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> Godly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row opens the vein, and lets out the matter that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders comfort, and cauſeth inward trouble in the ſoul? A gracious man takes a great delight in godly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: Oh! its a matter of marvellous comfort, to a Child of God, when he can kindly mourn for his ſins.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Spirit of God comforts the ſoul as he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="6">6 And laſtly, <hi>Though this be one great work of the ſpirit of God to comfort the hearts</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Diſciples; yet there are ſome ſpeciall ſeaſons where in the Spirit of God gives out this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> There are ſeaſons of ſadneſſe, there is a ſeaſon of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; there is need of it: <hi>There is a time to weep, and a time to laugh: and a time to mourn, and a time to dance.</hi> I ſhewed you ſome of the Seaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1 One ſpecial Seaſon of the Spirits comforting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſoul, is preſently upon the ſouls firſt ſalvation.

Thus God gives his people ſomthing before-hand to ſupport their ſpirits, that they may not faint; the Diſciples were full of comfort, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. and when was this? immediately juſt before they were carried before the Council, and whipt up and down like Vagabonds &amp; Rogues, for Preaching the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Seaſon when the Spirit gives out this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is in the time of ſuffering. God comes in the nick of time, eſpecially if a man ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake; if his ſuffering be upon the account of Chriſt, he ſeldome fails to ſend the Comforter for the relieving of his ſpirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13. <hi>But rejoyce, in as much as ye are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings, that when his glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy.</hi>
               </p>

It was in the wilderneſs that God ſpeakes to his Church. Thus I told you of Mr. <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> a Priſoner, who found no comfort in the time of his impriſonment; but when he was going to the ſtake, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>He is come, he is come,</hi> meaning the Spirit, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</p>

               <p n="6">6 Another Seaſon of Comfort is, When men are conſcientiouſly diligent in their particular Callings, then they walk with God. To this I gave you an inſtance in the Shepherds; they were faithful and diligent in their callings, they were watching over their flocks by night, and then the Angel comes and tells them <hi>Lo you is born this day in the City of David a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord,</hi> Luk. 2.11. A company of poor Shepherds keeping of their Sheep, God appears unto them, and manifeſteth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting preſence, when the Scribes and Phariſees, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their long prayers, and their ſtrict Rites and Ceremonies, hear not a word of him.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, By way of Motive. Though you have ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:109191:108"/>it is but little in compariſon of what you may have, and in compariſon of what you may ſtand in need of, though a Saint would not change the ſaddeſt hour of his life for the ſweeteſt hour in his former condition. If the Saints of God did enjoy the comforts that they might, oh what bleſſed lives might they live! but they are ſo full of trouble, as if there were no holy Ghoſt the Comforter. The people of God are oftentimes troubled without a cauſe; as that holy man, <hi>Why art thou caſt down oh my ſoul?</hi> He could not render a true account of his trouble; he was ſad, but he could not tell why or wherefore.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When there is cauſe, they are apt to be troubled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure. In thoſe caſes, where it is a ſin not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at all, the people of God are apt to be troubled over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the Iſraelites in their bondage in <hi>Egypt.</hi> It were a ſin for them not to be troubled; but they were ſo full of troubles that they could not hearken to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſo the Diſciples in the Text, it were a ſin for them not to be troubled for the abſence of Chriſts body; but ſo to be troubled, as if God could not comfort them without him, this was their weakneſs. And to come to our caſe, it were a ſin to ſlight this Diſpenſation of God that is coming upon us, if we ſhould not be troubled for the loſs of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Jeſus Chriſt; but to mourn before God under the ſenſe of this Diſpenſation, to mourn ſo much as to think that when theſe are gone; all is gone, to be ſo much troubled as not to hearken to the words of the Text, <hi>That we have a Comforter.</hi> I remember an admirable expreſſion of a child to his mother when his father was dead to ſhew. <hi>That out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings God can manifeſt his praiſe. Why Mother</hi> (ſays the child) <hi>though my Father be dead, yet God is alive.</hi> May I not ſay ſo to you? Though your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters be as it were naturally dead, yet is not God alive? is not the Spirit of God alive? Though you have ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, yet you have little in compariſon of what you may have, if you ſeek for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Study the excellent nature of the comfort, how little
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109191:109"/>ſoever a man hath of this ſpiritual comfort; it will ſwee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his condition, be it what it will be. When a man hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Spirit of God, he hath comfort in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; then, though a mans condition be never ſo bad, yet it is very good, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Though the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, though the fruit be not in the Vines, the labour of the Olive ſhall ceaſe, and the fields ſhall yield no meat; the flock ſhall be cut off from the Fold, and there ſhall be no Herd in the ſtalls, yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> He can fetch hope, and ground his faith upon the Promiſes, though the Providences and Diſpenſations of God be never ſo myſterious; the comfort of the Spirit doth make up the want of all other comforts: the comforts of Ordinances are ſweet comforts, Sermons-comforts are ſweet comforts, Sacraments-comforts are ſweet comforts; Ah, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Spirit can ſupply the want of all theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward croſſes do not hinder theſe inward comforts; a man that hath theſe comforts, may have a feaſt with bread and water; a little of this comfort is able to ſweeten a whole O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of ſorrow: <hi>In the multitude of the thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 94.10. So that when the hearts of Gods people are filled with ſad thoughts, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of themſelves, What will become of their Families, what will become of the Church of God, what will become of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and of the Ordinances of Chriſt? they are full of ſad fears, and diſtracting thoughts; when they have a multitude of thoughts, in the midſt of all, theſe ſpiritual comforts can comfort and refreſh the ſoul: Oh labour after a greater ſhare of this comfort.</p>
                  <p>God hath caſt us upon ſad times, wherein we ſhall have need of more than ordinary comfort: we are like to have troubles without; if we have not peace within, it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſad; we are like to loſe much of Chriſt bodily preſence, I mean in his Ordinances; many of thoſe Meſſengers that repreſent the perſon of Chriſt, and ſtand in his ſtead; if we ſhould not enjoy the other Comforter, our
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:109191:109"/>eſtates would be doleful; If we have darkneſs without, and darkneſs within, how ſad will that darkneſs be!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Labour to get more communion from the Spirit of God. This will raiſe and ſublimate your natural comforts, and turn them into ſpiritual comforts. A man never reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe outward comforts, till he come to taſte the raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſweetneſs of the holy Ghoſt; till he taſte the love of God; theſe give them a higher luſtre than the men of the world; though they enjoy much comfort, yet they do not enjoy half that a Child of God doth; the litttle that the righteous hath, is better than the great revenues of the wicked; to a Child of God a Dinner of green hearbs is more ſavory and pleaſant to him, than the ſtalled Oxe, becauſe a Child of God hath better ſauce with it.</p>
                  <p>Worldly men they ſmell to their flowers; it is only the godly man that ſucks out the honey; that all things are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him in love, out of this he ſucks comfort: A graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart ſees all theſe outward comforts, that they are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with the blood of Chriſt, and therefore theſe ſhould do him good, and he may take comfort that he hopes for what he hath not, as well as for what he may have; and he may take comfort in his condition, be it what it will he ſees all is for his good; ſuch a one believeth what he feeth not: So he believeth Gods wayes are wayes of truth though ſome more ſweet, and ſome more bitter.</p>
                  <p>Labour after communion with the Spirit in his comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting work is another. This is the beſt preſervative againſt all intanglements of ſin whatſoever: It is a great hour of temptation, and if our comforts do not lie above the world, we ſhall be greatly enſnared by the world. If a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſweet meats, he cannot reliſh ordinary food; ſo while theſe ſweet comforts lie upon the ſoul, he cannot reliſh theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary things in the world: What do ye tempt me with theſe things? ſayes a Child of God; what are theſe to the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt? The heart of man will ſeek comfort one way or another; and if he hath it not from the Spirit of God, he will ſeek it ſome other way; it he hath
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:109191:110"/>not comfort from the Spirit of God, he will ſeek ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſparks of his own kindling; rather then they will ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without comfort, they will light their candle at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſire. And as he delivereth from temptation on the right, ſo he delivereth from temptation on the left hand; he that is filled with the comforts of the holy Ghoſt, what are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to ſuch a man? He hath that within him that wil carry him through all danger; here is that comfort, and that life by Chriſt, which may eaſe us in our greateſt croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; this will make a child of God ſpeak of the ſufferings of this World as a light matter. Our light affliction which is but for a moment, ſhall work out for us a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of glory: they took joyfully the ſpoyling of their goods, becauſe in heaven they had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more enduring ſubſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. Some were tortured, receiving no deliverance, becauſe in heaven they had a better ſubſtance. Oh, if you would be kept from the ſnares of the world, let your comforts be above the power and danger of temptation from any thing here below.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 By way of Direction. How ſhall we have communion, and act Faith upon the holy Ghoſt as our Comforter? The holy Ghoſt is deſigned and appointed by God the Father to this Office. Now you know none love to be ſlighted in their office; and if we do not act Faith upon the holy Ghoſt, we ſlight his Office; therefore we ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to him in a way of believing: As we ſhould act Faith upon Chriſt for the pardon of ſin, ſo we ſhould act Faith upon the holy Ghoſt for a ſenſe of that pardon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Go often to Jeſus Chriſt, and beg him, and beſeech him to intreat the Father for you. Go to God the Father in the name of Chriſt, and beg it upon the account of Chriſts prayer and interceſſion, that he would ſend the Comforter, and you have good argument to enforce the Petition; the very ſame as the Diſciples, <hi>That Chriſt would,</hi> when he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 If you would have communion with the Spirit of Chriſt in his comforting work, <hi>Take heed that you do not lay up your comforts in the creature.</hi> This is for to ſeek for the living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead; thoſe that rejoyce in the creature, rejoyce in a thing of nought; and you that have an intereſt in God. God will not take it well at your hands, to ſeek it any where elſe, no, not in Ordinances; though God would have you to ſeek comfort in Ordinances, yet he would not have you to ſeek comfort from Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Sit down, and be much in duty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 6. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs, my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips, when I remember thee upon my bed, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on thee in the night watches.</hi> If you look at the beginning of the Pſalm, you ſhall find this Pſalm was penn'd when <hi>David</hi> was deprived of the Ordinances of God. Many a man complains that he lives uncomfortably; no wonder when he little thinks on Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Be much in the exerciſe of grace; <hi>Then they walked in

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Take heed of quenching and grieving the Spirit your Comforter, by neglecting his motions, or by acting any thing againſt the mind of the Spirit: Do not ſin againſt him as your enlightning Spirit; that will hinder him as your Comforter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> cloſe with a word of Comfort to the people of God. If it be one of the great works of the Spirit of God, here is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great comfort to thoſe that ſtick cloſe to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sure your comforts will be ſatisfying Comforts; ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, becauſe they are comforts of the Spirits working. The Lord Jeſus hath promiſed to make up the want of his, bodily preſence, by ſending his Spirit: He was now going from them, and tells them, <hi>That he could not ſtay;</hi> and this was ſad newes to the Diſciples, who where ready to break their hearts; and the beſt comfort that he could afford them, was to tell them. <hi>That he would ſend the Comforter.</hi> If Chriſt can comfort his people in the abſence of himſelf, ſurely he can comfort them in the want of all other comforts, that relate either to ſoul or body; and ſo in the want of mercies, in the want of outward Ordinances, he can comfort the ſoul. It is the Spirit of God that can comfort in the uſe of theſe; and, if he will, he can do it in the want of them; he can comfort us in the wilderneſſe where no water is; when he doth deny the meanes, he can cumfort us without; where he denies the ſtream, he can make us drink out at the Fountain.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And Laſtly, The people of God find hereby, that their comforts are abiding. Your liberty, your friends, ah! Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Miniſters may be taken from you; your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may be baniſh'd, your Miniſters may be impriſon'd; but here is a <hi>Comforter that abides for ever.</hi> And though they may keep your Miniſters out of the Pulpit, yet they ſhall not take the Comforter out of your hearts: So that when I ſhall not Preach any more to you, I ſhall <hi>Pray the Father that he would ſend you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever.</hi>

               <p>Our holy Apoſtle had been a long time with the Church, preaching among them, taking pains with them, both in publick and private, as you may ſee in the 20 <hi>verſe,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to them the whole Counſel of God, <hi>verſe</hi> 27. and now being called away, taken off by divine Providence, by the will of his Maſter, the laſt and beſt office that he thought he could do for them, was to commit them to the care of God, and to leave them in his arms, and to recommend them to his Grace.</p>
               <p>It would be more then the time would permit, to look over the whole Apoſtles Sermon, which is partly Narrative, and partly Conſolatory. Narrative, to put them in mind in what manner he had preached to them, from <hi>verſe</hi> 17. to <hi>verſe</hi> 27.

               </p>
               <p>O happy word!

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:109191:112"/>as for the converting of poor ſinners; and though God can build up a Saint immediately, yet ordinarily he doth it not but through the word of his grace, which is able to build you. <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> refer this Clauſe to God, anſwering to that of the Apoſtle. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.18. <hi>God is able to cauſe all grace to abound in you.</hi> But <hi>Eraſmus</hi> refers this word to the words of <hi>Gods grace, which is able to build you up.</hi> And this conſtruction is favoured by thoſe two places of Scripture, and may very well be meant both in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 15. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 1 21. both which places attribute to the Word of God, as this doth; and in the ſecond place, <hi>Receive with meekeneſſe the ingrafted word, which is able to ſave your ſouls.</hi> So that both theſe words may be referred to this Clauſe, <hi>The Word of God,</hi> and <hi>The Word of his grace;</hi> to God as the Principle, and to the word of his grace as the inſtrumental cauſe to build them up; as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>I commend you to the grace of God, which is able to build you up.</hi> The Apoſtle tels them, that he left them to ſuch a God, as through the Goſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Apoſtle commends this to his Church, that were ready to weep, and ſay at his departure, O <hi>Paul!</hi> God hath made thee a happy inſtrument of laying a good foundation among us, of doing a great deal of good to our ſouls, and we may bleſſe God that we ever ſaw thy face; but now, alas! thou art going from us, we are afraid all thy pains will come to nothing; we ſhould hope that if God had pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thee amongſt us, then we ſhould have been built up; and ſurely, if God had intended good to us, and brought us to Heaven at laſt, he would not have taken thee from us. No, ſayes the Apoſtle, be not diſcouraged, though I leave you, yet <hi>I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace.</hi> If I be here, it is God alone that muſt build you up; <hi>I</hi> am but a poor weak inſtrument in the hand of God, and when I am gone, God can build you up by ſome means or other; and carry you over, or thorow all oppoſitions, temptations and diſcouragements, till he hath fitted you for himſelf, and given you an inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified.</p>

               <p>The words hold forth the ſpecial care of this bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, though he muſt leave them, yet he takes care to leave them in ſafe hands, that was able to give a good account of them: You have the Apoſtle making a deed of truſt for the ſecurement of the Saints at <hi>Epheſus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his departure; or if you will, you have the Apoſtles laſt Will and Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="1">1 You have the Perſon making over this truſt, St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 You have the Truſt it ſelf, and thoſe were the Saints of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 You have the Truſtees, thoſe to whom this truſt is committed; and they are two fold. 1 To God. 2 To the Word of his grace. 3 Here is the time of making this Teſt, <hi>now I am ledving of you.</hi> 4 Here is the commendation of the Truſtee, from the power and ability of him to manage this truſt, and this is expreſſed in two particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1 He is able to build you up; and then</p>
               <p n="2">2 To give you an inheritance: as if he ſhould have ſaid, I will leave you with ſuch who are able to build you up. I might raiſe a multitude of obſervations from the words: as firſt of all,</p>
               <p>Doct. 1. <hi>Thas it ſhould be the care of a faithful Miniſter, when he is by the providence of God taken from a people, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to God, and to the word of his grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 As it is the duty of a faithful Miniſter to do it, ſo it is his comfort that he may do it, that he may leave his people in the hand of God, who is able to build them up in grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It may be the comfort of any Church of Chriſt, that when they are deprived of faithful Miniſters, that yet they are left in the hands of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Though God can by his infinite power perfect grace, and bring men to heaven without the uſe of means, yet we have no ground or warrant to expect one or other, but through the Word of Gods grace.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:109191:113"/>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, Though their be a glorious inheritance pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and prepared by Jeſus Chriſt, yet it is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by none but thoſe that are built up &amp; ſanctified; Or thus,</p>
               <p>None muſt look for an inheritance hereafter, but ſuch as are born of the Spirit and built up in grace.</p>
               <p>I might ſpeak to many more, but I ſhall gather all that I have ſaid into this one general Propoſition, which is this:</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That the best Farewel that a Goſpel-Miniſter can give to his people that he loves and labours amongſt, when he by the providence of God is taken from them, is, to commend them to the Goſpel, and to the word of his grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus doth our holy Apoſtle when he was taken from his people, and left to preach to them no more, he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them to the hands of God. And thus doth a greater then St. <hi>Paul,</hi> even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>the great ſhepherd of the Sheep,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls him, when he was leaving of the world, and could no longer preach to them, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them to God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11. And now ſays Chriſt to his Father, <hi>I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world, and</hi> I <hi>come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thy own name thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may he one as we are.</hi> And in the 14 <hi>I have given them thy Word;</hi> he commends them to God, and to the Word of his grace.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this truth, I ſhall explain theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Shew you what it is in a Miniſter to recommend his people to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What it is that he ſhould recommend them to God for</p>

               <p>Laſtly, Apply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is to leave them in the hand of God, to give them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g unto Gods care and keeping, as I ſhewed you in the opening of the words, to commend them unto God, is to do that for them effectually, which he would fain do Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially, if he had been ſuffered to continue among them As when a dying Father, or Husband commends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now let us conſider what it is that a faithful Miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and endeavors are to do for that Congregation that is committed to his charge: theſe 4 things eſpecially every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter endeavours to do while he is among his people.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Their converſion unto Sanctification.</item>
                  <item>2 Their building up, their Edification.</item>
                  <item>3 Their Protection and Preſervation.</item>
                  <item>4 Their Comfort and Conſolation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Their Converſion and turning to God. This is that that a faithful Miniſters heart is ſet upon, that he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert poor ſouls that are in a ſinful ſtate, that he may turn poor ſouls to God; that by often preaching, and praying, and counſel, he may bring them into a ſtate of ſalvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1. The Apoſtle there ſpeaks of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that they were the people of God in profeſſion; ah, but this was not enough, fain he would that they ſhould be the people of God in truth; this is the hearty deſire of every faithful Miniſter, not only to bring his people to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of godlineſs, but to the work and power of it in their hearts; not only to have the name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but Chriſtianity it ſelf; and this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the end of all his ſtudying, to get them to God by little and little, I till Chriſt be formed in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.11. <hi>My little children,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> travels in birth with the <hi>Galatians</hi> from a ſtate of nature to a ſtate of grace; he would get grace wrought in their hearts, he would get them ingrafted into Chriſt; and this is the end of his commending them to God, which he would fain have done, if he might have been ſuffered to preach to them. This is the language of a Miniſters heart; Lord, thou knoweſt that it was the deſire of my ſoul, that every one of this people ſhould be made holy by the Word; I would fain have begotten them by the Miniſtry to Jeſus Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:109191:114"/>but now by the providence of God I am taken off before my work is done; and thou ſeeſt yet there is a great many in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity, in a ſtate of death, and I am now likely not to do any thing more: now it is my care, that thoſe that belong to the election of grace, may be gathered home to thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To build them up in knowledge and faith. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that thoſe that are already ſanctified, may be further built up in their moſt holy faith; where there are the moſt eminent Saints, yet there is a great deal lacking. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives great commendation of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. They were a famous Church, and there were a great many eminent Chriſtians, yet there was ſomething lacking in their ſaith, and in their knowledge. Chriſt ſpeaks to one of his moſt eminent Apoſtles, <hi>Oh thou of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith!</hi> Though the foundation-ſtone be laid, yet there is a ſuperſtructure behind, and this is the work of Chriſt, the building them up, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. This is the end of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithful Miniſter, to make his people meet for Heaven; be would be feeding of them, that they may grow to the ſull meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt: and therefore every godly Miniſter deſires that he may be the Finiſher as well as the Author (under God) of their faith, that they may be built up to Chriſts heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3 A Miniſters aims are, that his people may be kept from danger. The people of God, after they are effectually called, they are continually in danger; they are as a Lilly amongſt Therns, as Sheep amongſt Wolves, as a beſieged City in the midſt of her Enemies.</p>
               <p>They have enemies without, and enemies within; ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without, the Devil is their adverſary.</p>
               <p n="1">1 They are in danger in reſpect of the Devil, who is a very potent enemy, a roaring Lyon, and a malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, malicious againſt God; an induſtrious enemy, he goes thout ſeeking whom he may devour; he compaſſeth the earth to do what he can to keep ſouls from Chriſt; he it a ſubtle enemy, that hath his Stratagems to catch
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:109191:115"/>and enſnare poor ſouls. Now it is the endeavour of every true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſecure his people by his counſel, and his prayers; for we are not ignorant of his devices, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. as it he ſhould ſay, I have moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Devils ſubtilty, Satan ſets to oppoſe them moſt; and this is one thing, to rob Miniſters of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation; of their Prayer; and therefore it is the deſign of Miniſters to ſtrengthen their people, in regard of Satans temptations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are in danger in reſpect of Seducers, that lye in wait to deceive.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They are in danger by the world, leſt they ſhould be frighted by its oppoſition.</p>
               <p n="4">4 They are in danger by their corrupt luſts, that war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſouls: Therefore every faithful Miniſter warns his people of thoſe, that their ſouls may be ſecured; this being that that a faithful Miniſter would do among his people while he is with them; when he is taken from them he commits them to God to be ſecured from all danger, as Chriſt in that place before, <hi>Father keep them in thy own hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Every faithful Miniſter ſeeks the comfort and conſolation of his people. It is their deſire to comfort the feeble hand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they are not Maſters of your grace, but Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of your joy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. Where the Goſpel appears in power, man will ſtand in need of comfort, under doubts, fears, and afflictions; and this is the deſire of every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, in their departure from their people, to ſupport the weak, to reſolve the doubted, to ſuccour the tempted; and when he is taken from them, and can contribute little to this work, he recommends them to God. A departing Miniſter may ſay to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, If God hath made me an inſtrument of ſpeaking comfort to your ſouls, you have cauſe to bleſs God for it. Now I can do no more, I muſt recommend you to God, whom (I hope) will be the God of your comfort when I am gone.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109191:115"/>
               <p n="2">2. This is the beſt office that a Miniſter can do for his people when he is taken from them: and that whether we look upon Miniſter or people, certainly it is the beſt office that a Miniſter can do for his people, <hi>To commend them to God</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 God is omnipotently, infinitely able.</item>

                  <item>2 God is all in all in the want of mercy.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, He is all in all in the enjoyment of mercy. When a people have a faithfull Miniſter placed over them by the providence of God, he can do nothing of himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. Our preaching is from the aſſiſtance of God; and when we have done all, we cannot make this effectual, we cannot give the ſucceſs; <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollo may water, but it is God that muſt give the increaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. Why do you keep ſuch a ſtir? one would have this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, another that; one would have <hi>Paul,</hi> another would have <hi>Apollo,</hi> another <hi>Cephas;</hi> are they not the Miniſters of God, by whom ye have believed? Our profit depends not upon the parts and gifts of a creature, but upon out bleſſing of God; it is God that muſt put this heavenly treafore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart, and it is God that muſt diſperſe it at laſt for the good and benefit of his people. The moſt eloquent <hi>Apollo's</hi> cannot perſwade obſtinate ſinners to lay hold upon the Goſpel; they may ſpeak to the ear, but it is God that muſt carry the word to the heart, either for conviction or converſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is all in all in the want of means. Let the inſtrument be never ſo weak, if it be in the hand of God it ſhall prove effectual: God can make a poor Fiſherman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to catch three thouſand ſouls at one time; and God chuſes to do his work by weak inſtruments that the praiſe may be of God: It is not the Miniſters parts or gifts, but onely the power of God that ſtrengthens the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:109191:116"/>ſoul, and ſanctifies, and builds them up, and comforts them. God is able to convert all unconverted ſinners in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; God can ſay, <hi>Ephata,</hi> be opened.</p>
               <p n="2">2 God is able to build up thoſe that are converted, God is able to make all grace abound, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. Thoſe that have little grace: God is able to make it increaſe God is the God of all grace. God can make every Saint perfect, entire, lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing; he can fill all the void places of the heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3 God can keep us in all tryals and troubles, God can keep up his people in the midſt of Apoſtaſie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.13. <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt them.</hi> God can keep them, that all the power of Hell ſhall not hurt them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 God is able to comfort the moſt diſconſolate ſoul. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may ſpeak comfortable words, but they cannot ſpeak them farther then to the ear, but God can ſpeak them to the heart; <hi>I will allure her into the wilderneſs, and ſpeak to the heart.</hi> God can comfort the poor ſoul, let the caſe be never ſo ſad, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As God is infinitely able, ſo he is infinitely gracious and faithful. See his Name in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. <hi>Full of power and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy.</hi> Is not God willing for the converſion of poor ſinners, willing as Miniſters? yea, a thouſand, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more. Hear how pathetically God ſpeaks, <hi>Turn ye, why will ye dye? hear, and live.</hi> He calls upon all men eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywhere to repent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God doth not onely deſire it, but purpoſe it, and reſolves. God that hath begun a good work, he will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, and ſo for their preſervation, he hath ſaid, <hi>That the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt them. Of all thou haſt given me I have loſt none,</hi> Joh. 17.11. Though God may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his people to be led away for a time, yet they ſhall be brought back again, and ſhall be kept through the power of God unto ſalvation. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but not one jot or title which God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How willing is God to comfort all his comfortleſs ones? what Mother can be more pitiful to her ſick child, then

               <p n="1">1 To Miniſters, it is the higheſt expreſſion of their love; What greater teſtimony of their love can they ſhew to their people, to do all that for them, that he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have done, and ten thouſand times more? Is it not an expreſſion of love from a dying father to his children, Dear children, I am now dying, I can provide for you no more, I ſhall leave you ſuch a friend that ſhall provide for you in a more abundant meaſure then if I had been with you?

               <p n="3">3 It is the greateſt ſatisfaction to his heart. A Miniſters leaving his people can never be ſatisfied in his own breſt, that he ſhould leave them, and commit them; and not to know to whom: but when he knows with whom he hath committed them, when he hath delivered them over to God, that firſt committed them to him, this is a great quietment and ſatisfaction to a Miniſters ſpirit: Every Miniſter takes a care of ſouls; God lays the people as a <hi>depoſitum,</hi> and will require an account of them at the laſt day. Now when a Miniſter is taken from his people, he cannot be ſatisfied, till he hath delivered back his truſt to God; Lord, here they are, and while I was with them I did what I could; but now I am taken from them, here I ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them back into thy hand; when I was in the world, I kept them in thy Name: And ſo it is beſt for the people to be left;

               <p>Firſt, By Exhortation. Thus the Apoſtle before and after my Text, And then by Prayer, for ſo doth St. <hi>Paul. Calvin</hi> looks upon theſe words as a Prayer brought in, <hi>always making mention of you in my prayers, Rom.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>And I truſt that I ſhall not only now, at this ſolemn par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but as long as I live, ſtill recommend you into the hands of God; though I ſhall not preach to you, yet I ſtill ſhall make mention of you in my prayers, that God would ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and comfort, &amp; preſerve you to his heavenly kingdom.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Why doth the Apoſtle commend them to the Word of his grace? For theſe two Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe all the good that any people can look for, is from God; it is declared and laid up in the Promiſes, and in the Goſpel; there is the Treaſure of God, it is in the Goſpel: <hi>The grace of God, which hath appeared to all men, bringeth ſalvation,</hi> Tit 2.11. We could never have known the glorious myſteries of ſalvation, had it not been for the grace of God; we could never have expected good, but from the Goſpel, that is the great <hi>Magna Charta</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath made over whatſoever concerns the eternal good of his people. We have nothing to ſhew for grace, and comfort, and heaven, and glory, but his Goſpel, that is the great deed of gift that God hath given to his people; poor ſinners might look a Saviour, if the word of God had not revealed it; thoſe people would have no ground to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſalvation, if God had not declared it in his Goſpel to beſtow it upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Goſpel is the only inſtrument by which God brings and conveys all that good to the ſoul that it ſtands in need of, all ſpiritual and temporal good that accompanies ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>God works nothing immediately upon the ſoul, but by the Goſpel.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:109191:117"/>
               <p>Firſt, If any ſoul be converted to God, it is by the grace of God: And as Converſion, ſo Sanctification, that is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the word of God; ſo likewiſe in Edification, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Preſervation.</p>

                  <p>God will be an All-ſufficient God; in ſtead of all thy friends in the world, you ſhall not need any that ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:109191:118"/>for you to protect you; God will be all in all, in ſtead of father, inſtead of mother, houſes, lands, relations; God will be better to you then ten husbands, then ten Miniſters; Ah, better then ten thouſand Worlds. God can ſweeten all your enjoyments, God can provide for you, and make you happy in the midſt of the wants of creature-comforts; God is a Sun and a Shield, he will give grace and glory, <hi>And no good thing will he with-hold from them that fear him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God contains all in himſelf <hi>Eminenter;</hi> get God and you get all. Let the World frown or ſmile, let it turn upſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down; though the Mountains be thrown into the midſt of the Sea, though the World be ſet on fire, yet a ſoul that is in Gods keeping is happy: <hi>God is a preſent help in time of trouble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 As God is an all-ſufficient friend, ſo he is a firm and a faſt friend to them; <hi>My father and mother forſook me, then the Lord took me up, Pſal</hi> 27.10. My fleſh and my heart fails, but God fails me not; though my Miniſter and my friends leave me, yet God will not leave me; he is engaged by his own promiſe, truth, and faithfulneſs, <hi>I will never, never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, &amp;c. leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you do not forſake God, God will never forſake you; if once you have ſo committed your ſelves to God, as God accepts the charge, he hath undertaken that you ſhall never depart from him. It is part of the Covenant, and he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to all the Relations wherein he ſtands to his people, as a Husband, as a Father, as a Maſter.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, How ſhall we commit our ſelves to God, that God may have a charge of us? I will give you one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Take God to be your God, and give up your ſelves to be his people; if you will, before you and I part, heartily and unreſervedly give up your ſelves to God, to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it will be the comfortableſt day that ever I ſaw, though in other reſpects it may be the ſaddeſt; as certainly God is your God, ſo certainly he will keep you; if you will avouch your ſelves to be Gods, I will avouch God to be yours.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 You muſt take God to be the portion of your ſouls
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:109191:118"/>inheritance, lay up all your happineſſe in God; for if you chooſe any thing elſe for your happineſſe but God, God will have nothing to do with you; God will be all or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Your hearts muſt ſay as <hi>Davids, Lord thou art my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> He accounted all nothing for God, God was his happineſs God was his portion, God was his All in All.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt make God the center of all your love and delight; God will have all from you, or nothing; you muſt not divide your affection between God and the world, you muſt love nothing in compariſon of him; love nothing but in ſubordination to him; as you would have God to be wholly yours, ſo you muſt be wholly his.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 You muſt take God to be the ſtrength and ſhield of your hearts; if you would have God to take care of you, you muſt caſt your care upon God, if you place your hope any where elſe, there will be no ſure hold; the Anchor of your hope muſt be caſt no where elſe; if you lay your burden any where elſe, God will not lend you a finger to help you; but if you place your hope in God, God will help you; your extremity ſhall be his opportunity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 You muſt take God to be the guide of your hearts; if you would have the priviledge of Gods guard, you muſt keep in Gods way; keep in Gods way, and you will be ſure of Gods protection; do you keep Gods precepts, and God will keep your perſon; do what God commands, and avoid what God for bids, and then you need not fear what will become of you.</p>
                  <p>Let the World frown, and Friends forſake you, reſolve that you will follow God whereſoever he leads you, then he will be your God all your dayes, and he will guide you here by his counſel, till at laſt he bring you to his glory: And this leads me to the ſecond Exhortation, in reſpect to the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Brethren <hi>I commend you to the word of Gods grace.</hi> I commend you to the Precepts of God, to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; I commend you to the Promiſes of God, to be believed by you.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:109191:119"/>
                  <p n="1">1, Keep them, and hold them faſt carefully; it is your treaſure, it is your life, keep it, and it will keep you, it is all that you can ſhew for Heaven: I leave it as a <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> if you part with it, take heed how you will anſwer it at the laſt day; it is the talent which God hath committed to you, for which you will be commended for keeping at the great day. Hold faſt the word of Gods grace, there is old tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by the Devil, and his Inſtruments, either to pull you from the word, or the word from you. Let any thing go rather than the Goſpel, let your Friends, your Eſtates, your Lives, rather than let go the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Study Gods word, do not keep them by for no purpoſe: <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them you hope for eternall life.</hi> There's the pearl of great price, there is direction, there is comfort: this book of God will make you wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>If you never hear Sermon more, you have enough by the uſe of the Bible to carry you to Heaven; There's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, there is holineſſe and heaven almoſt in every ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when you cannot have it preached to you. Be much in the ſtudy of it.</p>
                  <p>Then practice it conſcionably: Be not only hearers, but doers of it; let your converſation be ſuch as becomes the Goſpel. It was the Apoſtles advice to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and it's mine to you, <hi>Let your converſation be ſuch as becomes the Goſpel.</hi> Let your converſation become the Precepts, the Priviledges, the Promiſes of the Goſpel. Having then thus commended you to God, give me leave before we part, to commend God and his Goſpel to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Make it your daily buſineſs to walk with God; make him the companion of your lives; converſe with God every day in the inward of your hearts: He that is a ſtranger with God, God will ſoon be a ſtranger to him; and if you neglect God one day, you may be to ſeek him when you may moſt need him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Live in the daily exerciſe of grace and godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Live in the continual exerciſe of Faith, live by it, you

                  <p n="2">2 Be much in the exerciſe of the fear of the Lord all the day long, be afraid to ſin againſt God; in the ſecret of your ſouls mind his preſence, in all places, in all company, in all buſineſſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Be much in the exerciſe of Humility; live humbly and think better of others then your ſelves: Humility will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly adorn your profeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Be much in the exerciſe of Repentance. Be frequent and conſtant in prayer, <hi>Pray continually;</hi> do it ſpiritually, and do it exactly, as to the ſeaſon of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Be fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> Whatever you do for God, do it with all your might; do not put off God with the skin, but give him the marrow.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Be careful, not onely to keep up ſecret, but Family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip; the leſs preaching there is in publick, the more catechiſing and inſtructing there ſhould be in private.

                  <p>And labour to keep up that Chriſtian love which in this place hath been more eminent than any where I know. I would preach St. <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Little children, love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:</hi> And that my expreſſion may be pathetical, I ſhall ſpeak it in the words of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2, <hi>If there be therefore any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind.</hi>

                  <p>I now have but a word more, ſpeaking of yours and mine own comfort under this ſad Diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a Miniſters comfort, that when he is taken from his people, he can yet <hi>Commend them to God, and to the Word of his grace, which is able to build them up, and to give them an inheritance among them that are ſanctified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly, my dearly beloved in the Lord, this is my great work now, when I am a dying to you as to my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick preaching: My Beloved, I am very ſenſible that it is a very ſad and ſolemn thing for a Miniſter to be rent from a people that he loves as his own ſoul, that he hath laboured
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:109191:120"/>among: for to bid adieu to theſe ſolemn meetings, wherein I have preached to you, wherein we have min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled our ſighs and our tears before the Lord, wherein we have rejoyced, and ſat down together before the Lord at his Table, now to think that I muſt miniſter with you, and for you no more in theſe Ordinances, methinks it is a beart-breaking conſideration; to think that I am now dying in this Congregation; to think that I am now dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whilſt I am preaching; but this is my comfort under theſe ſad thoughts, that I can <hi>commit you to God, and to the Word of his grace;</hi> to one that is <hi>able to keep you, and to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are ſanctified.</hi> Like a dying Father, I can commend you to the care of ſuch a Friend, infinitely able to ſupply all that I could not do for you.</p>
                  <p>It is the comfort of a dying Father, when he ſees his children weeping round about him, that he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to a faithful friend, willing to do that for them that he deſired to do, and a thouſand times more.</p>
                  <p>I would hope that I have ſome children, that I have begotten to Chriſt by my Miniſtry, towards whom my bowels yearn; but this is my comfort, that I can put them into the arms of their and my heavenly Father, of their and my bleſſed Redeemer, to be kept by the power of God.</p>
                  <p>There are many poor ſouls that are yet in the gaul of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity; and if the Lord hath ſeen good, I would fain have ſeen of the travel of my ſoul in their ſalvation; but I can commend them to God, who knows them who belong to his Election, he can either reſtore me, or can do it by another hand; and you that are in any meaſure grown in grace, I would be willing to be helpful to your joy, and inſtrumental to your comfort, but <hi>I commend you to God, who is able to give all grace to you, and to keep you ſteadfaſt.</hi>

                  <p>This is a black day upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when ſo many faithful Miniſters are ſlain at one blow; this is a day of gloomineſs and darkneſs in many Congregations, for ſo many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be beheaded in one day!</p>
                  <p>What hath <hi>England</hi> commanded? is it not ſome high Treaſon? If we look to the cauſe of it, why ſo many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are as dead in one day, as ſo many children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Father.</p>
                  <p>And if we look upon the cauſe, what hath cauſed God thus to deal with us, we muſt complain.

This will be the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> and fling of our grief; and this ſhould be the matter of our grief.</p>
                  <p>And then, if we conſider the ſad Prognoſtick, what it doth ſeem to foretell: It is a ſign, that when God layes aſide ſo many faithful Miniſters, of ſome ſcourge and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity that is coming upon us.</p>
                  <p>But you that can lament this judgement, you that can lament the ſad deprivation of theſe powerful Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Remember, that though your Miniſter be dead, God can raiſe you up others in their ſtead; and where the way of inſtruments are wanting, he can do it without them; and thoſe that are begot in Chriſt, ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and thoſe that are yet unbrought in, who belong to the Election of Grace, ſhall in Gods due time, have
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:109191:121"/>the effectual work of the Spirit wrought upon their Souls; <hi>For he is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them that are ſanctified.</hi>
                  </p>

            <p>Before I go out I ſhall endeavour to ſhine in the whole light of this Text in theſe ſix or ſeven Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt takes notice of all the work, and trouble, and loſſes that we endure for him. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a godly word ſpoken but the Lord hears it, takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it; not a day of humiliation, not a tear, not a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not a ſigh, not a cup of cold water, but the Lord ſets it down: <hi>Item</hi> at ſuch a time thou didſt loſe ſuch a thing, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard ſuch a concernment. Now this knowledge lies in two things. 1. It implyes an Approbation. 2. A Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: <hi>I know what thou doeſt,</hi> what thou ſuffereſt, ſo as to approve it, and ſo as to recompence it. Now then if God takes notice of what we do and ſuffer for his Name, then either we muſt ſay, he hath not good enough, or not time enough to beſtow that good upon us, or not faithfulneſs enough to perform his promiſe, before we can be moved from his ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. Secondly, I obſerve, Believers in their pooreſt condition, when they have loſt all, they are rich: <hi>I know thy poverty, but thou art rich.</hi> The only wiſe man is the only rich man (ſo ſaith the Philoſopher) but the believer is the rich man (ſo ſaith the Wiſdom of God in the Text.) And the riches of a Believer lies in five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his Intereſt, he hath a God for his portion: Faith doth unite and implant into the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that we are become ſpiritually rich to the utmoſt degree of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: Saith <hi>David, The lines are fallen to me in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant place, I have a goodly beritage.</hi> All that rich love of God, which is ſtronger then death it ſelf: A rich Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace ſhines in the Promiſes as ſo many Pearls; he will not withhold any thing that is good, nor ſuffer any thing that is evil to fall upon us, that ſhall
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:109191:123"/>not turn to good. How rich are they that are rich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Believers muſt needs be rich in their Relation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>Our communion is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> They that are married to Chriſt, and have an intereſt in him, they muſt certainly contract very hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Allies, the Brother of Jeſus Chriſt, a Member of Chriſt: ſhe that marries a Prince or King, is a Queen. What title of honour ſhall we give to one that is eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Jeſus Chriſt,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Believer is honourable in his poſſeſſions: to name but two, poſſeſſion of grace, poſſeſſion of peace, grace and peace, there is your riches; ſo the Lord ſalutes you in his Word, the leaſt drachm of grace is more then all the world: And this is the character of one that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and thirſts after Chriſt. And then for comforts which are grounded upon grace, and the work of grace: for the ſpring of grace is a ſpring of joy: <hi>In the world you ſhall have trouble, but in me peace:</hi> And <hi>in the midſt of my troubled thoughts</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>thy comforts delight my ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A Believer is rich in regard of his expectation, that reverſion, that bleſſed hope that is reſerved for him. A Believer his character is, to long and look for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt the Believer is rich in the everlaſting Kingdom of glory.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Believer is rich in the things of this life: he can live above theſe things, he can be content without them; contentation is your riches; you ſhall want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good; why then have we not enough? and if we have enough, why do we not ſee our riches? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God doth not ſhake down the acorns from the tree of common providence, which he does to the herds of the world, but feeds us with childrens bread, ſhall we therefore repine? Let us ſee our riches even in the things of this life. He that believes on Chriſt, is in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:109191:123"/>as can know no want: He that is not in Chriſt cannot be rich: He that is in Chriſt cannot be poo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Judge not of of his condition by what he appears out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. A believer is worth as much as the promiſes come to, which are his Charter; as much as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven comes to, which is his reverſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. Chriſt takes notice of all the reproaches and blaſphemies of his Adverſaries: <hi>I know the blaſphemy of them that ſay they are Jews and are not, but are of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan.</hi> Chriſt counts himſelf reproached, when his ſervants and wayes are reproached: <hi>The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</hi> A Chriſtian doth quarter Armes with Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the reproaches of the black mouths, they are eſpecially taken notice of by Jeſus Chriſt. There is not a word they can ſpeak, but is preſently recorded among the <hi>Memorandums</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. Repent, if it be poſſible: the word in thy tongue, the thought in thy mind may be forgiven; I ſay, if it be poſſible, though a malicious ſcoffer does ſeldom return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. Whatever the Children of God ſuffer at any time before the grave, they muſt ſuffer ſtill. <hi>I know thy works and tribulation, (nay yet the wind is not over)</hi> in the next verſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſuffer.</hi>] After great expences of blood and treaſure, ſtill more heavy calamities: the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of tribulation doth riſe higher and higher till the believer reſiſts unto blood ſtriving againſt ſin: you muſt expect it, you muſt go with your lives in your hands, reſolving upon the greateſt trouble, to wade through a deep flood of calamities, not one piece of the Croſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 5. Chriſt uſually gives notice to his people in their ſufferings, he tells us beforehand. So <hi>Job</hi> 16.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.16. There never did befal any great tryal, but the Church of God had notice of it. <hi>Abraham</hi> had notice of <hi>Sodoms</hi> deſtruction: <hi>Noah</hi> had notice
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:109191:124"/>or the Old Worlds deſtruction: <hi>Abraham</hi> again had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ruine of <hi>Egypt:</hi> So the Anti-Chriſtian trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt come upon the Church, riſe higher and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſpecially in the laſt dayes: they are ſet down exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the book of the <hi>Revelations:</hi> And the Reaſons are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Gods people may not be offended when troubles come, <hi>Job</hi> 16.1. <hi>I told you that you might not be offended.</hi> Look for them, that you may not be terrified by reaſon of the unexpectedneſſe of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he might convince us, that there is nothing befalls us without his privity: he that foreſees them, he muſt needs ſee them; he that forecaſts them, he muſt needs have the ordering of them; <hi>Not a hair of your heads falls to the ground without his counſel, without his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we might provide for them: <hi>Know you not the coming of the Son of Man?</hi> When Chriſt comes with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table mercies, uſually he ſends his harbingers; we muſt thereore be as <hi>Noab: Being warned of God, believing his word, he was moved with fear, and built an Ark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. What ever troubles come upon the people of God, they have no cauſe to fear: <hi>Fear none of theſe things thou ſhalt ſuffer: Be careful for nothing</hi> (it's very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive) there is a feat that we cannot be without, and there is a fear we may not admit; A fear there is of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, this furthers our preparation, prayer, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our ſelves, flying to the Lord Jeſus under his wings: that's a bleſſed fear of trouble that makes us to come nearer to God: But then there's a fear of Diſpondency, Apoſtaſie, a fear of Diſtraction, ſo as to be diſmayed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. There's no ground of ſlaviſh fear as to God; no ground of a fatal fear of man, of any thing that man can do to us: And the Reaſon is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All our ſufferings are ordered by a Father: 'tis the Potion that thy Father gives thee to drink: whatever bitter Ingredient there is in it, ſtill it's of thy Fathers
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:109191:124"/>procuring: why wilt thou ſuſpect it to be poyſon, and afraid of it? no, be encouraged.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fear not: Chriſt ſtands by thee in all thy ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: The Angel ſtood by Chriſt in his Agony to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him: but Chriſt ſtands by us in our Agony, in our contending for the Faith: <hi>Fear not</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>O Worm</hi> Jacob, I <hi>will be with thee:</hi> He is alwaies with us, though ſometimes as to ſenſe 'tis otherwiſe: nay if Chriſt be nearer to us at any time, 'tis when trouble is moſt near us. (<hi>O Lord, be not far off, for trouble is near,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) That trouble is bleſſed that engages God to be nearer to us, that engages us to come nearer to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fear not whatever 'tis that we ſuffer: there ſhall be ſufficient ſtrength given to bear it, to go through it: God will never lay more upon thee than he will enable thee to bear: and if thy ſtrength be encreaſed propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, it is all one for thee to lift a pound weight, and to lift a hundred pound weight.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fear not any of theſe ſufferings, becauſe none of them ſhall hurt thee: God hath ſaid he will ſtave off all evil from thee <hi>(no evil ſhall come nigh thy dwelling) and he that fears the Lord, ſhall not be viſited of any evil,</hi> Prov. 19.23. No hurt ſhall come, nothing ſhall come to thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs (that is) as to thy Soul, and the Soul is the man: there ſhall be no imparting to thy Soul, to thy beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; thou ſhalt loſe nothing but that thou canſt not keep, nothing that enters into the other world to make up thy happineſſe, thou ſhalt loſe nothing to do thee good; no loſſe of communion with God, no loſſe of Communion ſhall not be diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>But why do I ſpeak of no hurt; there ſhall come a great deal of good by theſe troubles. When God calls thee to ſuffer, and thou wilt put him off with doing, make it up that way, God loſes by it, and thou doſt; but if you would buckle your ſelf to that ſervice God calls for; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive when 'tis active; paſſive when 'tis paſſive, this is that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:109191:125"/>piece of godlineſſe that is <hi>great gain.</hi> Thou wilt either live or die, and ſhalt gain both wayes; if thou live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, thy graces ſhall be better, the ſpirit of God ſhall reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, if thou die, thy glory which is weighty, ſhall be double, the weightier the Croſs, the weightier the Crown; be content to go as Chriſt did from the Croſs to the Crown. Let us ſtrive againſt our carnal luſts, thoſe few things that are ready to choak our faith, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage God, and cut the ſinews of our endeavour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſervice God calls us to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider our troubles are like to be great: here is the ſymptoms of Gods diſpleaſure upon us, here is the pouring out of ſuch a providence among us, as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attended with deſtructive Judgements. <hi>Sodoms</hi> cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity was coming when one <hi>Lot</hi> was diſcharged: <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many's</hi> calamity was coming when one <hi>Luther</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; Lord then what woe is this to ſleep away ſo many faithful, painful labourers at once! but it's our duty to ſuffer patienttly, and not complain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As our troubles muſt be great, ſo, many will fear, and in fearing faint; we ſee it come to paſſe, and you will find it more and more: There are thoſe that run with the Foot-man, that will not keep pace with the Horſe-men, that may be left behind, and be trod under foot: our troubles are likely to ariſe according to all we can learn from Scripture and Providence, and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there be that will ſhrink.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider 'tis a very difficult thing to ſtand ſtedfaſt in a day of evil: you cannot name any of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but when they have indeed come to it, their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fears have been working ſo <hi>as their feet have almoſt ſlipt,</hi> they have been almoſt gone, but that for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, that he would lay no more upon them than he would enable them to bear.</p>
            <p>O but you will ſay, What will become of the publick intereſt, of the name and Church of God? &amp; what will become of my private intereſt?</p>
            <pb n="253" facs="tcp:109191:125"/>
            <p>I anſwer, you have no ground of fear (according to Scripture) in either of theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt as to the publick name of God, the intereſt of his Church, of his truth, of righteouſneſſe, of a real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, intereſt of our prayers &amp; hopes, be not afraid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God bears a dear reſpect unto his people: they are repreſented in Scripture by all names that may import dearneſſe and nearneſſe unto him: the intereſt of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is bound up in his people: he calls <hi>Iſrael his glory:</hi> We know the intereſt of men is that which moves the world: but the intereſt of God, of his Glory, no doubt will be the ground of ſafety and ſecurity unto us, even till God take us to Heaven. For the intereſt of Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, God made Hell; and for the intereſt of his mercy and grace he gave Jeſus Chriſt to die, to take effect here amongſt the Children of men; do you think God will forget his intereſt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember Gods wayes are in the deep: you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what God is doing; when you think thoughts of deſtruction and confuſion, my thoughts towards you ſaith God, are thoughts of peace: And truly God he does not ſave a Soul, nor does not promote the Salvation of his Church in any eminent degree, but it is in a way that is croſs and contrary to the ſenſe and expectation of fleſh and bloud: inſomuch you know the darkneſſe of our condition has been the entrance upon deliverance; as juſt before the day dawns, its the darkeſt of the night when God looked and there was none to help them, ſaies he, my arm brought ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Thus it is with you that are effectually called: you have received the ſentence of death; the entrance upon your deliverance, is the darkeſt time of your condition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God can do great things, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <hi>Fear not, thy God O</hi> Sion <hi>can do great things.</hi> 'Tis the diſparagement that we offer to God, we aſcribe more to the Creature than we do to God: when we give way to carnal fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:109191:126"/>fear not what man can do, becauſe of the power of God which was his ſhield and buckler; Is any thing too heavy for God? and when God does great things, he uſually goes on to do greater; though he may ſeem to ſuffer his work to be thrown back to confuſion, and his people may be ready to ſay, we thought he had redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that degree of Reformation ſhall not be loſt. You know in <hi>Luther's</hi> time, take any ſpecial degree of Reformation in the Church, and it ſeemed to be oppoſed by the gates of hell: when it was brought upon the ſtage to any hopeful degree, then it was taken as it were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of ſight for a while: but it was never loſt: thus God is but making way for his own glory to appear in theſe great works.</p>
            <p>O but you will ſay, what ſhall become of my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? It is enough God hath promiſed that we ſhall not want any thing that is truly good, and that nothing that is evil, ſhall fall upon us, and lie upon us: though we do not ſee deliverance, it ſhall be: whatever our ſad thoughts and tremblings of heart may be, yet give God the glory of his Word: Take theſe few Directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Strive to ſtrengthen thy Faith. Faith is that which layes hold on Chriſt: and Chriſt is your ſtrength: therefore Faith is ſaid to do that which Chriſt does: let every day drive thee to a renewed act of Faith: Take heed, be not ſhaken in the faith of the Cauſe, be not ſhaken in the Faith of Chriſt <hi>(fides Cauſae, fides Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>)</hi> Be not ſhaken upon the Cauſe, which upon utmoſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, we find to be according to the word, hold that: <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, but not one jot and tittle of this Cauſe.</hi> And then do not ſhake in the Faith of Chriſt, that is, in your laying hold, in your applying your ſelves to him, in your reſting and ſetling upon him; beg of God to ſtrengthen your faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Get more Self-denial: we muſt forſake all, we muſt not except any thing. A man would part with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109191:126"/>his life as eaſily as with a pin off his ſleeve, if he had but ſome conſiderable growth in Self-denial.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Get a great deal of love towards that Chriſt, that loved us with a love ſtronger then death: get love of that Chriſt that may be ſtronger then life. Let nothing in the world be of any conſideration with you, ſo us Chriſt may be magnified in your bodies: love will breed courage, and caſt out fear; ſlaviſh fear before God, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fear before men.</p>
            <p>Get a true inſight into an account of ſuffering and troubles whence they are: they iſſue from the ſame love with redemption of your ſouls from Hell, and your glorification: God doth every thing in purſuance of the purpoſe of his love: he doth every thing according to the platform and pattern of his thoughts towards us from eternity.

Every word hath its weight: Who ſhall do it? The Devil. What ſhall he do? <hi>Caſt you into priſon:</hi> How far? <hi>Some of you:</hi> How long? <hi>Ten dayes:</hi> For what uſe? <hi>That you may be tryed.</hi> Chriſt, as he hath Satan in a chain of providence, ſo he hath a chain of reſtraint; it is Chriſt that puts a circle about him, he cannot cauſe a hair of your head to fall, he is in the hand of Chriſt, and they are under him, and his hand, as they are againſt him: If God lets alone his Enemies, what ſhall they not do? If God lets alone his People, what ſhall they do?</p>

            <p>The Lord is exceeding merciful, he cannot hold when the Enemy comes to inſult, to blaſpheme and revile; <hi>Now will I ariſe,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and ſet him at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from him that puffeth at him:</hi> There is not only a judging of their Enemies hereafter, but a judging of them here: <hi>the world ſhall ſay, Verily there is a God that rewardeth righteouſneſſe, verily there is a God that judgeth the earth.</hi>

            <p>There is a difference between the afflicting of Gods people, and judging their enemies: In the intention, and extenſion: one is for ruine, the other in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; one is a light affliction, the other a load. And then for extention, one is for ever, and the other is for time, for ten dayes, Then our afflictions ſhall have an end, I and a comfortable end. Are not theſe two ends comfortable, the end of our ſins, and the end of our ſorrow? God will reſtore comfort to his mourners; let us be mourners during the time of mourning, God will quickly cloath us with garments of praiſe: there ſhall be an end of our ſufferings, never an end of our joy and glory.</p>

Wherefore I take you to record this day that <hi>I</hi> am pure from the blood of all men, for I have not ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to declare unto you all the Counſel of God. Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood, for I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves ſhall enter, not ſparing the flock, alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them, therefore watch, and remember, that by the ſpace of three years, I ceaſed not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among all thoſe that are ſanctified; I have coveted no mans ſilver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, your ſelves know, theſe hands have miniſtred to my neceſſities, and to thoſe that were with me. I have ſhewed you all things, how that ſo labouring ye ought to ſupport the weak, remembring the words of our Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, it is more bleſſed to give then to receive. And when be had thus ſpoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all, and they all wept ſore, and fell upon <hi>Paul</hi>'s neck and kiſſed him, ſorrowing moſt of all for the words which be ſpake, that they ſhould ſee his face no more, and they accompanied him unto the Ship.</q>
            <p>BEloved, I have read unto you the words of a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſter to his Hearers. The caſe being my own, I thought I could not pitch upon a more fitter place to take my farewel withall.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:109191:129"/>ſomething to you by way of Analyſis to it, and thereby you may judge of the Analogy of it. In this parting ſpeech of <hi>Pauls</hi> you have two parts.</p>

            <p>Secondly, their ſorrow, expreſſed by their weeping, they could not part with ſuch a Miniſter with dry eyes, but ſaith the Text, <hi>They all wept ſorely, ſorrowing moſt of all for the words which he ſpake, that they ſhould ſee his face no more.</hi> They wept, and they all wept, and they all wept ſorely; a ſore weeping when this Miniſter and this people parted. From whence I note this, That there is occaſion and matter of great ſorrow when people looſe a godly Miniſter. <hi>Paul</hi> was not the firſt Miniſter that ever parted with a people, nor the <hi>Epheſians</hi> the firſt people that ever lamented the loſſe of a faithful Miniſter. See how the people lamented <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.1. <hi>And Samuel died, and all Iſrael was gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lamented Samuel.</hi> O that brave, that powerful preaching <hi>Samuel</hi> is gone.

When Chriſt was put to death, how did his followers lament him? Is it not a lamentable ſight to behold a poor weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten rotten ſhip, without Maſt or Tackling, in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt? Good Lord, what will become of the Ship and Mariners? Is it not a ſad ſight to ſee a flock of ſheep invironed with a band of wolves, and no ſhepheard to protect them? thus it is with people when their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is gone. Miniſters themſelves have wept and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when they have thought of departing from their own people, and that for theſe two cauſes.</p>

Thus it was with <hi>Joaſh,</hi> while <hi>Jehojada</hi> that good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter lived with him, and inſtructed him in the way that he ſhould walk, he kept to the true worſhip of God; but after <hi>Jehojada</hi> dyed, he turned Idolater, and perſecuted the ſons of <hi>Jehojada,</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.21.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they knew that after their departure they would ſuffer others to corrupt them. This was that that made <hi>Paul</hi> uſe theſe words to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> (Ver. 29.) <hi>For I know that after my departure grievous wolves ſhall
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:109191:130"/>enter, not ſparing the flock.</hi> And therefore well may you mourn when a faithful Miniſter is taken from you. I ſhall ſay no more, only a word or two to <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſpeech, wherein you have.</p>

               <item>Firſt, he ſpake ſomething by way of vindication of himſelf.</item>
               <item>Secondly, he ſpake ſomething by way of exhortation to them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, You may obſerve in <hi>Paul</hi>'s farewell ſpeech, ſomething by way of vindication of himſelf; and it is not amiſſe for a Miniſter, when he is to depart from a people, to ſay ſomething in vindication of himſelf; for there are enow that will, when his back is turned, lay falſhood and ſcandals to his charge, which they never durſt do to his face: <hi>Samuel</hi> knew this, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for it, in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.1. <hi>And Samuel ſaid unto them all, Behold</hi> I <hi>have hearkened to your voice, and have made you a King, now behold the King walks in and out before you;</hi> I <hi>am old, and of grey hairs, and muſt now leave you,</hi> I <hi>have walked before you from a child to this day, and now witneſs againſt me before the Lord, whoſe Oxe have</hi> I <hi>taken, or whoſe Aſſe have</hi> I <hi>kept? whom have</hi> I <hi>done wrong to? or whom have</hi> I <hi>hurt? and of whoſe hand have</hi> I <hi>received a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?</hi> he ſtood here upon the juſtification of his life and carriage towards them, that he had not been a ſelf-ſeeking, or oppreſſing man unto them; and thus did <hi>Paul</hi> vindicate himſelf to the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> give me leave to divide <hi>Paul</hi>'s vindication into four or five parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He tells them that he had conſtantly preached amongſt them, notwithſtanding all the afflictions which encountred him, (v. 19.) <hi>Serving the Lord with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of mind, with many tears and temptations
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:109191:130"/>which befel me through the lying in wait of the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He vindicates himſelf, by telling them the manner of his preaching, (<hi>v.</hi> 20.) <hi>I have taught you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and from houſe to houſe:</hi> you know I may fitly apply this to my ſelf, for I have not only taught you publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>, but in many of your houſes alſo. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He vindicates himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> telling them the matter of his preaching; and I bleſſe God it hath been my method ever ſince I preached among you (v 21.) <hi>teſtifying to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks, repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Christ;</hi> and this is my rejoycing (now I may preach no more) that I have ſpent my time in declaring unto you the ſunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals and grounds of ſalvation and not in frivolous Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He vindicates himſelf by declaring the impartiality of his preaching, (v. 27.) I <hi>have not ſhunned to declare unto yot all the Councel of God.</hi> Oh my Brethren, though I cannot ſay I have declared all the Councel of God; yet this through grace I can ſay, that I have not ſhunned to declare any of it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Paul</hi> doth clear his Doctrine, and withall, himſelf, by telling them he had preached freely, (v. 33. and 34.) <hi>I have coveted no mans ſilver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye your ſelves know that theſe have ministred to my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and to thoſe that were with me.</hi> I bleſſe the Lord I can with a good Conſcience ſafely ſay, I have cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither your ſilver nor gold, neither am I a penny the richer for what I received of you; it was not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of any thing of yours that made me at firſt accept of this place: yet this I ſhall ſay for your honour, that you have richly and liberally beſtowed your favours upon me: but as there is ſomething in his own vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; So,</p>
            <pb n="264" facs="tcp:109191:131"/>
            <p>Secondly, there is ſomething by way of Exhortation to them, (v. 18.) <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> before he leaves them hath ſomething from God to ſay to them; from whence I note this, That the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, before they quite leave, have ſomething to ſay to them from God; it was thus with the holy men of old: <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was dying, called all his So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> before him, and to every one he gave counſel, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; <hi>David</hi> when he was upon leaving the world, he knew he ſhould not live long, he calls all <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto him, ſayeth thus unto them, (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.8, 9.) <hi>Now therefore in the ſight of all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep, and ſeek for all the Commandements of the Lord your God, that you may poſſeſſe this good Land, and leave it for an inheritance to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after you for ever. And thou</hi> Solomon, <hi>my Son, know the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind, for the Lord ſearches all hearts, and under ſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts, if thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forſake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</hi> Thus you ſee it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath been the cuſtome of holy men of olp, when they are leaving the World, to ſay ſomething to their people; ſo now here, I am come unto you this day as a dying man, for you know when this day is gone, I muſt no more preach among you; and I know you are come, to ſee what I ſhall leave you for your Legacy, which that I may do, take theſe Twenty things, as Counſel, and Advice from a dying man; and O that they may remain with you when I am dead. Firſt, I ſhall give you Ten by way of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſecondly, Ten by way of Counſel; my Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Beloved, I beſeech you, as you tender the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of your Souls, take heed of breaking the Sabbath day, of Prophaning the Lords day; it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that whereever Religion hath flouriſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:109191:131"/>any people, there they have ever been careful, and conſcientious of the Sabbath day; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide, where Religion is gone to decay, and people grown to prophaneneſſe, there they are alwaies looſe on the Sabboth day; pray remember, I hope you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, for God calls upon you, and commands you ſo to do, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>Remember the Sabboth day to keep it holy:</hi> do not you take ſo much liberty as ſome will give you: whoever you are that refuſe thus to do, I will leave this aſſertion upon you: thou wretched man, hath God given thee Six dayes, and reſerved but one for himſelf? and wilt thou Rob him of that too? what! if he had given thee but one, &amp; kept ſix for himſelf, would you be ſo vile, as not to keep them? how much more then, when God hath given thee ſo much preheminency in time, this is the firſt, be conſcious in keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed, and beware of Idolatry; this was <hi>John</hi>'s caution to his beloved Children, (1 Epiſt. 5. v. 21.) <hi>Little Children keep your ſelves from Idols.</hi> There is no ſin to which, nor no ſin by which we are in more danger than <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, there is no ſin to which we are in more danger than <hi>Idolatry: Moſes's back was no ſooner turned, but the people made them a brazen calf, and bowed down to it, and worſhiped it as their God.</hi> (Exod. 32. v. 4.) <hi>Jehojada was no ſooner dead, but</hi> Ioaſh <hi>returned to Idolatry;</hi> if we were not prone to this ſin, what is the reaſon all the world turns Antichriſtians ſo Univerſally.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As there is no ſin, to which we are in more danger, ſo there is no ſin by which we are in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than Idolatry. I do confeſſe, if you will keep your garments clean, &amp; undefiled with the mark of the Beaſt, it may be you may come under ſhrewd temptations; yet I intreat you, as a dying man, as you love your Souls, and for God's ſake, flee from Idolatry notwithſtanding
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:109191:132"/>your temptations; for God hath promiſed that under all the temptations that happens to you, he will ſupport you, if you flie, and withſtand the thing you are tempted to, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. v. 13.) <hi>there hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to men, but God is faithful, &amp; Will not ſuffer you to be tempted, above that you are able to bear, but will with the temptation, alſo make way to to eſcape, that you may be able to bear it;</hi> now ſee what uſe the Apoſtle makes of this promiſe, in the next verſe he follows with theſe words, <hi>my dearly beloved, flee from Idolatry, ſeeing God will uphold us,</hi> let us withſtand any temptations, to this end, that God may uphold us; this is the ſecond Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take heed of Apoſtacy, of a degenerating, backſliding ſpirit; that ye do not fall off from the truth, and ground of the wayes of God, which ye have known, and profeſſed it is true; it may be for ſtanding to your principles you may loſe the love of man; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it may be ſo, but hear what God ſaith, <hi>If any man fall back, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him;</hi> if thou goeſt on, mans Soul may have no pleaſure in thee, but if thou falleſt back, Gods ſoul wil have no pleaſure in thee; thou doeſt by Apoſtacy declare to all the world, that thou haſt made trial of the wayes of God, and thou doeſt not find them to be as good as thou thoughteſt they were, nay not ſo good as others: O take heed of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing the wayes of God, here how God complains of thoſe that ſo do (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.10.) <hi>Go unto the Iſles of</hi> Chittim, <hi>and behold and ſend unto</hi> Kedar, <hi>and take diligent heed and ſee, whether there be ſuch a thing, hath a Nation changed their God, for thoſe which are no Gods? but my people hath changed their glory, for that which will not profit. Hear O Heavens, and be astoniſhed at this, for my people have committed two evils, they have forſaken me the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living waters, and have hewed to themſelves broken ciſterns that will hold no water;</hi> Whatever it is that would
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:109191:132"/>lead thee to Apoſtacy, beware and flie it, eſpecially evil company, (of which I ſhall ſpeak more anon) let your love to Chriſt be augmented, and love of your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed; for unleſſe you love Chriſt, very much, and your ſelves very little, I cannot hope that you will ſtand to your principles.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Beware of Covetouſneſſe; it is Chriſts Caution, (<hi>Luke</hi> 2. ver. 15. <hi>Take heed, and beware of Covetouſneſſe:</hi> here is a Caution, with a double action, take heed, and beware: believe me Brethren it ſtands upon us ſo to do, for it ſteals upon us before we be aware of it; there is no perſon will deal more injuriouſly with a Chriſtian than a covetous man will; he will betray his Life (if it were in his hands) into his Enemies hands for Money, as <hi>Judas</hi> did. A covetous man he will injure Chriſt in his Ordinances, he will not come at them, for the love he bears to the World will not ſuffer himſtruly (quoth he) I have loſt this, or that, while I was hearing a Sermon, I'le go no more, I muſt ſtay at home, and look after my buſineſſe; I could give you many inſtances of this, but time will not give me leave; I ſhall only touch this one, what was it but the Love of this World that kept thoſe who were bid to the Marriage Feaſt of the Great King of Heaven from coming? One had, bought a piece of Ground, and he muſt needs ſee it; another had bought Oxen, and he muſt go to prove them; a third had Married a Wife, and therefore he could not come. Of all perſons in the world, a covetous man, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor will not endure to bear the Croſſe of Chriſt, (<hi>Phillippians</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>For many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are the Enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uction;</hi> who are theſe? what manner of perſons are they? why they are ſuch who make their Belly their God, whoſe glory is their ſhame, and who mind earthly things. A covetous man he will lie with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sarhira;</hi> he will ſteal with <hi>Achab,</hi> he will murther with <hi>Ahab,</hi> he will betray with <hi>Judas:</hi> what will he not do to attain his covetous deſire? this is the Fourth, beware of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You that have not taken warning yet, I beſeech you take warning now; have a care and avoid evil company, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11.) <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſſe, but rather reprove them; come out from among them, and be ſerarated from them.</hi> Never go into a wicked mans company, if before you go, you have not a probability of doing good, or getting good. Conſider with thy ſelf, is there any likelyhood that thou by thy wholeſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs may do him any good, if there be, then go on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; if not, draw back, avoid them, fly from them, for their ſteps tend to perdition. By wicked company thoſe two things have been effected.</p>

            <p>Sixthly, my ſixth Caution is this: Oh have a care of having the leaſt finger on your hand againſt a Saint, it is dangerous to have a thought, word or act againſt the people of God, it is dangerous to have a thought amiſſe of them (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.3.) <hi>They imagine miſchief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man</hi> (that is againſt a Saint) therefore they ſhall all be ſlain, for their bare imagination they ſhall be cut off. It is dangerous to ſpeak againſt them, <hi>How durſt thou</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Miram</hi>) <hi>to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſervant Moſes;</hi> and immediately he ſmote her with leproſie as white as Snow; It is dangerous to act againſt them, and it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.5.) <hi>Touch not my anointed, nor do my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets no harm.</hi> Perhaps you would ſay you would not do them any harm, if you thought they were Gods people. Oh but take heed leſt they prove Gods people, and then it were better for you, if a milſtone were hung about your neck, and you caſt into the Sea, than to offend the leaſt of them.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Let me beſeech you all to take heed of complying with this ſinful world, whoever doth, do not you: but take up that good reſolution of <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s, <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Though all elſe forſake God, yet will not I, yet let not us, <hi>I beſeech you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you would not conform your ſelves to the faſhions and manners of this wicked world.</hi> Oh take heed of conforming your ſelves to the Converſation of this world, but walk harmleſſe, and ſhine as lights in the midſt of a crooked, and perverſe generation, if we will comply with the world, I mean to be as moſt of the world are, that is temporizers, time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I mean, that there are many here that are but bare profeſſors; let me ask you that are only profeſſors this one queſtion, Is Religion good or bad? if it be not good, what is the reaſon thou art not aſhamed to profeſs it? if it be good, what is the reaſon thou doſt but profeſſe it? by thy bare profeſſing, thou loſeſt the love of man; by no more then profeſſing, thou canſt never gain the love of God; ſo that on all ſides thou art like to be miſerable: The world will hate thee for being ſo good, and God will hate thee for being no better. What a ſad thing is it that thou loſeſt thy comforts in this life by profeſſing ſo much, and thy comforts in the life to come, by no more then profeſſing. Thus you have heard what I have to ſay by way of Caution: I ſhall now ſpeak to you by way of counſel. The former ten were Negative, theſe ſhall be Poſitive.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>I</hi> intreat you all, that above all things you would mind the one thing neceſſary: that you would not trouble your ſelves ſo much with many things of little concernment, but mind the great thing for which you came into the world. Oh my friends, will you ſpend your time for that which will not profit you, and your money for that which is not bread: Look after Grace, labour to get an Intereſt in Chriſt, of which if you be unprovided, you will be undone for ever, and it will be better for you, you had never been born: Oh, gain Chriſt, and then you will be fitted for all times, all troubles, and all conditions that can happen unto you; you will be endued with all wiſdom and with all riches; if you gain not Chriſt, all that God doth to you, and for you, will n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, My ſecond advice and counſel unto you is this, That you would live as you would die, live to day as if you muſt die to morrow: Let me ask you, would you be content to die in the ſtate you are in? if my ſoul doth not deſire to be in a better ſtate whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus it is, God hath appointed to every one a time to live in, and that but a ſhort time too, and in that time he hath appointed afflictions to attend us; if we will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, is it not wiſdome in us then to provide for them?

Beloved, I believe you will ſcarce put ſo much coufidence in a man, as to receive a ſum of money without telling it, becauſe he ſaith it is right; and yet will you receive all that your Miniſter tells you is truth for truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trying it? you muſt not be ſluggiſh in your working for God, but put forth your ſelves to the utrermoſt. You muſt make the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffer violence, and take it by force, but then,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The fifth Direction which I ſhall give you, is about hearing the Word, how you muſt behave your ſelves when you hear. I take it for granted you will hear, I hope you will, for brown bread is better then none, and a little is better then none at all; yet I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you take theſe two words of Direction:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Try the word you hear by the Truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly; Try your ſelves by the Truth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Try the word you hear by the Truth; if it be not conſonant to that, believe it not, let who will pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sure you will c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll in your words again; nay, inſtead thereof, he repeats them over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; as we ſaid before, ſo I ſay again, if any one preach any other Goſpel then that which you have received, let him be accurſed. If any man pretend a Revelation from Heaven, and cannot bring Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for what he ſaith, do not believe one ſyllable. Take the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> for your example, they would nor believe <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, until they had ſearched to ſee whether it were ſo or no; but then, as you are to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y the word you hear by the truth, ſo try your ſelves by the word; you hear as a truth, that <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Now try your ſelves by this truth, and ſee whether or no you walk after the fleſh, or after the Spirit: I have likewiſe two Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about the preaching the Word.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Do not you receive the Word for the perſons ſake that brings it? I am apt to think, that many of you will receive a Truth of one mans bringing, which you would not receive of anothers; and thus ye receive the Word of God with reſpect of perſons, which you ought not; but firſt receive the Word for its own ſake; and ſecondly, receive the perſon for the Words ſake, (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12, 13.) we beſeech you brethren to know them which are over you, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> times we live in, and I ſhall tell you, how you ought to behave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſelves in two particulars.</p>
            <pb n="273" facs="tcp:109191:135"/>
            <p>Firſt, Blame thy ſelf moſt that the times are ſo bad; there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral complaint about the ſadneſſe of the times, but no particular; every one puts the cauſe away from him, and inſtead of accuſing themſelves, are alwayes accuſing others: <hi>Ahab</hi> he ſaid to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha, Thou art he that troubled Iſrael: Eliſha</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ahab, Thou art he that troubled Iſrael: Adam</hi> ſaid to God, <hi>The Woman which thou gaveſt me did give to me, and I did eat:</hi> The woman ſhe ſaid, <hi>The Serpent beguiled her:</hi> Thus do we put it off from our ſelves to others: No man ſaith with <hi>Jonas,</hi> for my ſake is this come upon you, I am the cauſe of all this: No man ſaith, what have I done? would you have the times mend? Oh then, every ſoul of you condemn your ſelves, and amend your wayes, the times would not be ſo bad, if we were not ſo bad; would you have the effect ceaſe, then ſeek to remove the cauſe. But then</p>
            <p>Secondly, Pray not ſo much for better times, as better hearts; for had you never ſo good times, and not good hearts, your bleſſings would be curſings, good times, without good hearts, will but fatten you the ſooner to the ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, If you cannot do the good you would, then do the good you can; many people are ſo ſullen, that becauſe they cannot do all they would do, they will do none at all. I beſeech you, be not of this temper; what though you cannot ſerve God in publick, will you not therefore ſerve him in private? why may you not do as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was bid to do. (<hi>tolle legit</hi>) take up and read? this will be a reading and praying time with you; and now you cannot hear as formerly you have done; oh pray more, and read more, and the leſs you have in Publick, the more you may have in private, you may read and pray, we are not forbidden that yet, let us then make uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Eightly, My intreaty is unto you all, that you would be careful and circumſpect in your converſation. (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15.16.) <hi>See then that ye walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time, becauſe the dayes are evil.</hi> Walk as becometh the Profeſſiors of the Coſpel, and labour to be blameleſs towards God and man. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, what notice will there be taken, when any Profeſſor doth but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> aſide, and do any thing amiſs, it is the joy of wicked mens hearts to ſee it, and how diligently do they watch for it, and often wiſh i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look on;</hi> I am ſure a wicked man may better commit ſevon ſins, then a Profeſſor one; for it is the failings, the bad lives of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, that makes Religion ill ſpoken of, and hinders many a weak ſoul from cloſing with it: ſure think they, their Religion cannot be good, their converſations are ſo bad; let us therefore be wary, and careful in all our actions.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Mourn and lament for the ſin you cannot hinder; it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>id of <hi>Lot,</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8.) that his righteous ſoul was vexed with
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:109191:136"/>the wicked converſations of the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Oh that we were but ſo good as we ſhould be, then ſure it would grieve us more then it doth to ſee the wicked and abominable lives of thoſe among whom we live; though thou doſt not blaſpheme God thy ſelf, yet it is thy God that is blaſphemed, and ſhall not that trouble thee? how canſt thou but reprove them whoever they be? When a ſick man ſeeth his Wife, Children, Friends, and Phyſician, lamenting his condition, ſure it will make him think his condition is worſe then he thought i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or very bad at leaſt, or elſe why do they take on ſo, if there was no cauſe of fear? Thus it may be thy reproof may work upon a wicked man, if when thou heareſt him blaſpheme God, thou lamenteſt his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and puts him in mind of his ſad eſtate, it may make him lay that to heart then, which he never did before.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, The laſt thing that I have to beſeech of you is, That you would love one another: I have not at all ſought to proſelyte you to my way, but whatever you ſee in whoever it be that is of God, oh love it, be he of what profeſſion he will, he is a godly man: Oh then love him, you cannot love God if you do not love his people: let brotherly love continue; your Miniſter muſt not continue, oh then let brotherly love continue. (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.20.) <hi>If any man ſaith he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God, and hateth his Brother, he is a lyar, and the truth is not in him; for if he loveth not his Brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen? We believe,</hi> ſaith <hi>John</hi> in the next Chapter, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and he that loveth the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter, muſt alſo love him that is begotten.</hi> You would be loth to do otherwiſe in civil buſineſs: will you refuſe commerce with a man, becauſe he is contrary to you in opinion, becauſe he is not a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of your City; be not then ſo far from loving one another, as to bear hatred one to another. Thus you have heard what I had to ſay unto you by way of caution and counſel: Oh that they may make ſuch impreſſions on your hearts, that they may be your continual practice in your lives and converſations. I ſhall now cloſe with the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (2 Cor. 13.11.) <hi>Finally Brethren, Farewel, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you:</hi> And the Lord grant, that both ye and I, when we come to the Judgement Seat of God, render up our Accounts with joy, and receive an immortal Crown with Chriſt in Heaven, until which Day I beſeech Almighty God to keep you, and preſerve you in his fear. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               </hi> From both theſe ſignifications, you have theſe two Obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Our firſt great care ſhould be this, with all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs to apply our ſelves to the knowledge of the things of the Goſpel;</hi> wee muſt with the Angels <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p n="2">2. As the word imports an act of memory, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, it affords us this Obſervation, <hi>viz. Next to our knowing of it, ſhould be our care to retain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the glorious Truths of the Goſpel.</hi> 'Tis all one, not to <hi>remember,</hi> as not to <hi>know;</hi> wee muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend to Wiſdomes words, but muſt keep them in the center of our hearts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If you do,</hi> hence obſerve, <hi>'Tis not enough to know and remember, but wee ought to do according to what wee know, and practice according to what wee remember.</hi> 'Tis ſome ſlight kind of happineſs to <hi>know,</hi> but ſo to <hi>know,</hi> as to <hi>do,</hi> this is the happineſs; If you know, if you do. Wee muſt not only bee <hi>hearers</hi> of the word, but <hi>doers</hi> of the word.

            <p>Thus I have cut the words in peeces. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Obſervation is that I would firſt commend from the ſuppoſition, <hi>If you knew,</hi> that carries in it an act of memory; namely, That as it is our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> care to <hi>know,</hi> ſo it ſhould be our next care to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> what wee have known. To this end let mee help your memories by way of a Summary rehearſal of our <hi>Morning-Exerciſe.</hi> The firſt Sermon that was preached to you was built upon
<q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Iſa. 55.3.</hi>
                  </bibl> Hear and your ſoul ſhall live.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From that Text, this Doctrine, That <hi>that ſoul ſhall ſurely live, ſpiritually, bleſſedly, eternally, that ſo hears, as to come to Chriſt himſelf.</hi> The grand que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion upon that point was this, <hi>What is to be done that wee may ſo hear?</hi> 'Twas anſwered, ſomething was to be done before, ſomething at, ſomething after hearing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Before hearing;</hi> That holy dutie of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calls aloud for holy <hi>preparation;</hi> ſo much at leaſt as ſettles the bent of the heart heaven-ward; ſo much at leaſt as makes us humble, and hunger after ſpiritual Manna; ſo much at leaſt as raiſes the heart into a poſture of expectation of ſome divine and ſpiritual good from God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a right demeanour in, or at hearing, which conſiſts</p>
            <p>Firſt, The hearer ought to propound to himſelf ſpiritual, and right <hi>ends,</hi> and that</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively, This muſt not be the hearers end, to come and judge either the Word, or the Miniſter of it; nor</p>
            <p n="2">2. To come and hear things that will tickle his fancy, if hee deſire that, let him go to thoſe ſinks
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109191:138"/>of all wickedneſſe, <hi>Play-houſes;</hi> nor</p>
            <p n="3">3. Muſt wee propoſe this our end, meerly to better our parts; nor</p>
            <p n="4">4. Meerly to know, much leſs meerly to bee known, that it ſhould be ſaid of us, that <hi>wee have been at the Morning-Exerciſe every day this month.</hi> But, our end ſhould be to <hi>profit</hi> by what wee hear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.33. <hi>Wee ſhould hear that our ſouls may live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Wee muſt labour to approve our ſelves true <hi>Goſpel-hearers;</hi> And to that end</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wee muſt be <hi>wakeful</hi> hearers; 'tis dangerous ſleeping by a Candle ſet up by God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee muſt be <hi>Reverent</hi> hearers: in the fear of God wee muſt worſhip, though not <hi>towards,</hi> yet <hi>in</hi> his holy Temple.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Attentive</hi> hearers, our ears and hearts ſhould bee like <hi>Lydia</hi>'s, open to attend to thoſe things ſpoken by <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 16.14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Receptive</hi> hearers: Wee muſt take in what wee hear, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. And this muſt be done with <hi>Faith,</hi> with <hi>Love,</hi> with <hi>Joy,</hi> with <hi>Delight,</hi> with <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> with <hi>particular Application:</hi> and this too, not as the word of ſuch a man, or ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; I abhor that wicked notion among you, the head of ſuch a party, and I know not what: But, as it is in deed and in truth the Word of God: That man never hears as a Saint, that when hee hears, doth not look moſtly at the Word, as it is the Word of the God of Saints. And if thus wee apply our ſelves to the Ordinances truly, wee are in immediate capacity to have the Glory, Spirit, and Power of Chriſt to reſt upon us in hearing; And this leads mee to</p>

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>What is it for a Beleever to glory in the power of Chriſt reſting on him?</hi> that is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To have the heart ſo full of Chriſt, that it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109191:139"/>cannot contain it ſelf, but it muſt be burſting out, as it were, and running over in holy Exaltations and Triumphs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To bee ſo much in the admiration of Chriſt, as that to a carnal eye it makes a man ſeem to bee ridiculous: what a goodly perſon was <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Michals</hi> eye, when hee danced before the <hi>Ark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To reſt on Chriſt ſo, as to look out for nothing elſe, &amp;c. to terminate and confine all the deſires of the ſoul, in, and upon, and towards Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To oppoſe Chriſt to any, to every thing that doth in any way in the world either injure or indanger him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Why ſhould a Chriſtian rather glory in this power of Chriſt reſting upon him, than in any inherent grace that is given unto him?</hi> upon theſe Accounts,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe all that a Chriſtian by inherent grace is able to do himſelf, is through <hi>Chriſt; I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe if there be any acceptance of what a Beleever doth with the Father, this alſo is through Chriſt; the gift is accepted, not for the gift ſake, but for the ſake of the merit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If ſo be a Beleever ſhould glory in his graces, there is a poſſibility of falling, but being clad with, and reſting in the power of Chriſt, there's an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of miſcarrying. Thus the Saints of God have their infirmities, frailties, their multitude of frailties and infirmities: yet have they reaſon to glory in that <hi>power of Christ</hi> which reſts on them, on <hi>earth,</hi> but much more reaſon if they will look up, and ſee the <hi>tongue</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ingaged for them, <hi>i. e.</hi> interceding for them in <hi>Heaven;</hi> And that lets mee into</p>

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and that by a <hi>Similitude. As in water face anſwereth to face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Redition, So doth the heart of a man to man.</hi> Or in the words, theſe two generals to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Glaſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. An <hi>Object</hi> to be ſeen in this Glaſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Glaſs,</hi> a notable one, that's two fold. <hi>A dead Glaſs, Water;</hi> A <hi>living Glaſs,</hi> the <hi>Heart of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Object</hi> to be ſeen in theſe Glaſſes: In the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109191:141"/>dead Glaſs, the <hi>face of man</hi> is to bee ſeen; In the living Glaſs, the <hi>heart of man;</hi> There's all the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Complections, of the Sons, nay, of the Souls of the Sons of men to bee ſeen. That as by looking into the water, you may diſcern your own and other mens Countenances, and that plainly and clearly; So, by looking into your own hearts, if you could have a Caſement into the hearts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, there may you ſee, of what <hi>Spiritual Complection, Conſtitution,</hi> and <hi>Make</hi> you are, as clearly as a man may ſee his face in Water. <hi>As in Water, &amp;c.</hi> From theſe words this great Truth, that <hi>the heart of every man in the world is a looking-Glaſs.</hi> 'Tis ſuch a looking-Glaſs wherein he may ſee himſelf, his Condition, Conſtitution, ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection whether it be morally, ſpiritually, ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally good or evil. For the right improvement of this looking-Glaſs, three things neceſſary; which are optick principles but clear to thoſe that have either phiſical or natural light.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be an <hi>Object</hi> that muſt bee ſeen. And oh! what viſible objects are there in the hearts of men? Man is call'd a little world, a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of the whole world. The heart of man is the man. The heart of man is like the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> which contains all ſorts, all kinds of clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Beaſts: 'Tis an Epitomy of Heaven and Hell: What is there in the heart of man? Who but God can fathom the depth of it? There are more objects in the hearts of men, then Stars in Heaven, or drops in the Ocean.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be <hi>light</hi> to actuate this object; If it were dark, we could never ſee it. There muſt be light both to actuate the eye and object; Now this light that actuates the eye and object, 'tis either the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109191:141"/>
                  <hi>natural light,</hi> the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> the light of <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> the light of <hi>common Illumination,</hi> the light of the <hi>Word,</hi> or the light of the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> By all theſe lights we come to look into this looking-glaſs, our hearts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There muſt be an <hi>Irradiation from the object, i. e.</hi> a beaming forth from that object, ſome Species or Ideas that carries the object to the eye, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes out to the ſence what that object is: this beaming is by action from the heart (mark it, for it may be as neceſſary truth as was Preached among you) that look what the ſtream is to the Fountain, what the beam is to the Sun, that the action is to the heart, whether the act be manent, or tranſient, whether <hi>Internal</hi> in thought, purpoſe, election, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in joy, in love, in fear; or <hi>External,</hi> in the life, in the practice, and in the converſation: So that look as a puddle ſtream alwaies declares a corrupt Fountain; So all your humble holy, faithful thoughts, ſpeak a clear ſpiritual heart within, a holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſpeaks a holy Affection, and a holy Affection, declares a heavenly Conſtitution, a new Nature. Now for the <hi>Uſe</hi> of this, is the heart of man a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs?</p>
               <p n="1">1. See from hence, of what concernment the actions of men are, whether Internal or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: The actions of men are like the ſtreams, you may certainly find the Fountain by them, they ſpeak the heart, as the Root bears the fruit: 'Tis of infinite concernment, 'tis the Fountain of what principles within, and converſation without: deſcend but into thy own heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſhews the ſad condition of all <hi>natural</hi> poor ſouls, your hearts are looking-Glaſſes, but they are looking-Glaſſes in a Dungeon of darkneſs, there
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109191:142"/>be Toads, Vipers, and Devils there, but thou canſt not ſee them, that haſt no ſpiritual Light.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is Conſolation to Gods People; Is the heart of man a looking-Glaſs? What reaſon have they to rejoyce in their hearts, that are the beſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſſes in the world, not like our Gallants looking-Glaſſes that muſt not bewray their wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, ſports, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theirs will repreſent their Hearts, Complexion, Condition, and Nature to them Nay, in that Glaſs may be ſeen the face of a God: Nay further, becauſe thy heart doth anſwer to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart, and his to his, what ever Grace in any Beleevers, it is there in thy heart, <hi>ſemine</hi> there's the ſeed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By way of exhortation; Is the heart a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs, then keep the looking-Glaſs very chary, make much of it; above all keepings keep thy heart, and that <hi>with all diligence,</hi> in <hi>all places,</hi> at <hi>all times,</hi> and in <hi>all things;</hi> If any thing under Heaven will keep thee holy, it is the keeping of thy heart. There thou mayeſt ſee all thy ſpots, defects, deſperate Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſies, Infernal Atheiſm, all the deliques of thy Soul: How prone to commit, as vile ſins as ever committed by the vileſt of the ſons of men; once more, keep it <hi>clean,</hi> and keep it <hi>cloſe:</hi> Look into thy heart, and thou ſhalt find it to bee a Coppy of the Role of Eternity, where thou ſhalt ſee thy very name written in Letters of Gold or Blood: for wee looking into our hearts, may and do know, that we are paſſed from death to live, and that upon this ground, becauſe we love the Brethren.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A comfortable <hi>Concluſion,</hi> that a Chriſtian may make, from that property, he may know, hee may be aſſured by this, that he is <hi>paſſed from death to life,</hi> becauſe he <hi>loves the Brethren.</hi> The obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus, <hi>a Chriſtian may know his real Converſion and Tranſition to eternal life, by this Character among the reſt, becauſe he loves the Brethren.</hi> This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was ſlipt into theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That every Beleever may have an aſſurance of his Tranſition from death to life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>love to the Brethren is one of the great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Symptomes of mans Regeneration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Chriſtian may know his real Converſion, and Tranſlation to eternal life;</hi> Such a great and real change is there wrought in every Beleever at his Converſion, and this wrought by ſuch a great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and infinite cauſe, the Spirit of God, and this cauſe, working by ſuch real and powerful means and inſtruments, the great Word of God; and this done notwithſtanding the great oppoſition that is made
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109191:143"/>by a poor ſinner againſt the word; and when wrought it hath ſuch real and grand, effects upon a Beleever, that 'tis impoſſible but a Beleever muſt needs know this his tranſition from death to life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Love to the Brethren is the great ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of mens Regeneration. Love to the Brethren,</hi> not taken <hi>ſolely, ſingly,</hi> as if this was the onely Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but <hi>concomitantly,</hi> taken with others, but beyond and above all others; this is the privy ſeal of God on the ſoul, if yee have inflamed it with <hi>love, hee may know hee is paſſed from death to life.</hi> The <hi>Uſe</hi> was of <hi>Confutation</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> thoſe grand enemies to Goſpel-Truths, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers peace. They abhor this Doctrine of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by it, their <hi>Purgatory</hi> would fall down, their <hi>Popes</hi> Kitchin would grow cold. They tell us, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers cannot attain <hi>Aſſurance</hi> in this world; no.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why hath God commanded us to make our Calling and Election ſure? and will God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand impoſſibilities, ſuch as cannot be wrought by our, or his own power?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Other Saints have attained this Aſſurance, this New Name, and White Stone within them.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>That's by extraordinary Revelation.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>IN theſe words you have a <hi>Warning-Peice</hi> diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an <hi>Elect Lady,</hi> A ſerious Item to an Elect La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and her Religious Family, <hi>to look well to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they loſe not the things they had wrought.</hi> And this is grounded on a double reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Damage</hi> of ſuch as begin well and hold not out, <hi>They loſe the things they have wrought.</hi> That were ſad, that ſo much ſhould be done, and all ſhould be loſt at laſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Advantage</hi> and benefit if we do go on, then <hi>we ſhall receive a full reward.</hi> The <hi>obſervation</hi> was, <hi>It much concerns all thoſe, that have begun well, that are looked upon by Miniſters, and thoſe that are godly, as if they were truly godly, that have entertained the Truth and the Profeſſion of the Truth, to look well to it how they stand, to continue, to go on, to hold out in their holy Profeſſion and Converſation.</hi> Look to your ſelf you Elect Lady, you her Religious Family look
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109191:148"/>to your ſelves, that you loſe not the things you have wrought. There's all the reaſon in the world it ſhould be ſo; The <hi>Election</hi> of Beleevers ingages us it ſhould be ſo, we are choſen that we ſhould bee ſo; If we do not look well to our ſelves we may chance to loſe all we have wrought. It too too often falls out that after a <hi>hot</hi> fit of <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> there comes a <hi>cold</hi> fit of <hi>Apostaſie,</hi> this cold fit of Apoſtaſie cauſed by a ſharpe winde of Perſecution, or by a melting, thawing Sun of proſperity; either by our natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy and mutability within, (wee love new changes, we love to be changable) or elſe the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Seducers from without. Again, there hath been, are, and will come trying ſeaſons; were you never ſo ſincere, think not all the work over and done as ſoon as converted; As ſoon as come out of <hi>Egypt</hi> there's a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> and <hi>Red-Sea</hi> to paſſe thorough, <hi>Mideanitiſh Women, Gyants, &amp;c.</hi> to conteſt with: Therefore no wonder hee writes, <hi>look to your ſelf.</hi> Then</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here ſee <hi>Election</hi> ſhuts not out the <hi>uſe of means:</hi> You are an <hi>Elect</hi> Lady, yet look to your ſelf.</p>

You ſcandalous <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance</hi> we Preach, is no <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>ſloth</hi> and <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> Though you ſhall be ſaved, yet look to your ſelves: you ſhall not periſh, yet keep in the Ship.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Orthodoxneſs of Faith and ſoundneſſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is not enough to make a good Chriſtian: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Lady, you make profeſſion you are ſanctified, but you muſt look to your ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not enough to have a well ordered Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, Oh Lady! look to your ſelf as well as to your Family.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The buſineſs of Religion is not the work of one day: As long as you have life, look to your ſelf.</p>

               <p n="1">1. By the <hi>metaphors</hi> unto which it is reſembled in Scripture, which ſpeaks either its profit, pleaſure, uſefulneſs, or neceſſity: Thy Word is a <hi>light</hi> to my

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Job</hi>'s valuation, <hi>i.e.</hi> The words, all the words of his mouth, precepts as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, threatnings and directions, as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes

From their <hi>deſires after</hi> the Ordinances; <hi>My ſoul panteth, longeth after, &amp;c.</hi> 2. From their hearty content and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in them. 3. From their bitter <hi>lamentation</hi> under the <hi>want</hi> of them. 4. From their <hi>diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi> to <hi>enjoy</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Religious perſons really underſtand their <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>want</hi> of them: They know the Ordinances of God to be the <hi>food,</hi> the ſpiritual fodder of the ſoul: The <hi>walks</hi> of God, where God is pleaſed to take his Turns; The <hi>Inſtruments of Divine Glory.</hi> The <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy</hi> of Chriſtians; their <hi>Chriſtian Armour</hi> and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements, to conteſt with Sin, Satan, the World; and, as <hi>Starrs</hi> that lead to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> no wonder the Ordinances are ſo precious in the eſteem of all truly Religious. Then 1. Know your priviledge, yet you enjoy Ordinances. 2. Lament the ſad condition of thoſe poor titular Chriſtians on the one hand, that have Ordinances, but enjoy them not; they know not the worth of them. And true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians on the other hand, from whom the Ordinances are gone, and whether ever they will return they know not. 3. This reproves thoſe to whom they are not precious. But, how ſhall I know the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are precious to mee? Anſwer, If thou carries thy ſelf towards them, as towards what thou lookeſt on as precious: tell mee, 1. Art thou greedy of all opportunities of enjoying them? 2.

By way of <hi>Conviction</hi> to thoſe mad men that tell us of being <hi>above, i. e.</hi> without Ordinances: what, was it ever heard of any of Gods Saints in Scripture that ever they ſaid they were <hi>above Ordinances?</hi> 3. For <hi>inſtruction</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: It will be ſeaſonable to conſider what you ought to do if God ſhould deprive you of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Hee did not ſay, 'tis <hi>probable,</hi> but ſuch a thing is <hi>poſſible;</hi> therefore make <hi>proviſion,</hi> lay in proviſion before-hand, <hi>proviſion</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> of <hi>Comfort,</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> againſt a day of darkneſs. And if it ſhould come, here's <hi>counſel</hi> given to us, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation</hi> laid before us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Counſel</hi> given us, if ever it ſhould be. 1. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bewail, mourn over the Lords abſence; weep till you can weep no longer. 2.

Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reflect back on thy former enjoyments; oh the Houſe, the Tabernacle of God, &amp;c. And <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect</hi> 1. To excite your thankfulneſs to God, that ever you did enjoy them. 2. To ſuck ſtrength from the Ordinances; to chew the cud, and get ſtrength of them. 3. For humiliation; for ſinning away, and provoking God to take them away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>Conſolation,</hi> that the people of God may not utterly fail; then 1. Know in ſuch a condition, that though your condition be exceeding bad, yet better than many thouſands, they never had Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. 2. God is able in ſuch a caſe to ſupport without Ordinances: when hee calls into the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> hee can carry along without <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> 3.

An admirable Dehortation: wee are at a pitch, wee are reſolved, and if there be any Attractive in mee, or my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you have it in this, <hi>I and my houſe-hold, wee will ſerve the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Obſervations</hi> were,</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:109191:152"/>1. Sincere Chriſtians have much more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the judgement and practice of God, his Word, Saints, than in the judgement and practice of the World: Hee knows their judgement to be depraved, their choice and practice corrupt, their end and concluſion worſt of all; therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hee makes a better choice. 2. They have the beſt Teſtimony in the world for their choice, the Spirit and Son of God, that this is their choice; therefore no wonder, &amp;c. But how do they chuſe God?

               <p>The firſt <hi>Uſe</hi> was by way of <hi>Examination;</hi> is God choſen as the chief object of our ſouls love? can we truly ſay, there is none in Heaven but thee, none upon Earth I can deſire beſides, or in compariſon of thee? Can wee ſay in having a God, the lines are fallen unto mee in a pleaſant place, yea I have a goodly heritage? Is communion with God our Heaven upon Earth?

               <p n="1">1. <hi>In times of ſufferings and afflictions; true Chriſtians are to make a narrow inſpection into their hearts, to ſee how they ſtand affected.</hi> Thus did the <hi>Church</hi> here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To keep ſtedfaſt and cloſe with God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all afflictions and ſufferings wee undergo, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from, or for God, is the duty and commendation of Saints.</hi> 'Twas our duty, and 'tis our honour, Lord, &amp;c. In proſecution of this point, theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven preliminary Theſis was laid down.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When man was firſt created, his heart ſtood rightly bent towards God, as his great center and mark.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When man fell, his heart immediately drew off, and <hi>turned back</hi> from God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though this be the caſe of fallen man, yet poor creature, he ſees it not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The very <hi>Formalis Ratio</hi> of ſin, that wherein the <hi>formality</hi> of ſin conſiſts, is in this, not ſo much in ſinning againſt God, by outward Acts, as in the hearts departing from God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All true <hi>Converſion</hi> to God begins at the <hi>heart.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. When once the heart of a Beleever is brought back to God, no ſuffering or affliction is able to turn that heart from him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When a man ſtill retains the ſame eſteem and eſtimate of God that ever he had. When <hi>Job</hi> looks upon God as a God fit to bee <hi>bleſſed,</hi> though God be plundering of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a man retains ſtill the ſame affections, the ſame love to him, delight in him, fear of him, as much as ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When wee hope and truſt in God as much as ever: <hi>Though hee kill mee, yet will I truſt in him.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>THe words are an alluſion to a <hi>City</hi> of <hi>refuge</hi> and from hence this <hi>Obſervation, Jeſus Chriſt will be for a ſure refuge to all thoſe that make him their fear</hi> and <hi>dread.</hi> And the truth is, there is the greateſt reaſon in the world Chriſt ſhould be ſo, Saints ſtand in greateſt need of this Sanctuary; They are a poor
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109191:154"/>weak, helpleſſe, generation of Creatures, but they have a Rock of refuge; <hi>The Conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houſes in the Rocks:</hi> Chriſt bears deareſt love to them: They are moſt precious to him: They are his <hi>Jewels,</hi> what will a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, if he will not preſerve his Jewels? Will Chriſt be a Sanctuary? Then 1. See the true reaſon why the Saints of God are of ſuch an heroick Spirit, even when troubles look them in their faces, and ring in their ears, they have a God to flie to, a Chriſt to reſt on. 2. See the reaſon of that conſternation of Spirit that ſeiſes on wicked men in times of trouble. Hide mee from the wrath of the Lamb, why? They have no refuge to go to, and how ever it is with them now, you ſhall hear nothing but howling and lamenting, when God ſhall come to avenge the blood of his Saints. 3. Be exhorted to make <hi>Christ</hi> your <hi>Sanctuary</hi> get into this City of Refuge, and for motives conſider, 1. Your abſolute need of a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctury: You are at the power of the world, in the paw of the Devil, in the mouth of danger, in the mouth of Hell. 2. All other things in the world are not ſufficient to become a Sanctuary; You may run to the Rocks, but they cannot hide you, you may make an arm of fleſh your ſtrength, but it will prove an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Reed, and run into your hands, you may make Riches your refuge, <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong Tower,</hi> but rather, 'tis a Caſtle in the Aire, you may make honours your refuge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All things unable to be your Sanctuary. 3. Conſider what a large, free, preſent, well furniſhed, unchangeable Refuge and Sanctuary Chriſt is: There are many, nay, all things in Chriſt, in which a poor ſoul may take Sanctuary: Doſt thou want Righteouſneſs? He is the righteous one: Doſt thou want Sanctification,

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Concoct this Book by a practical beleef of what is revealed in it: do not think your own noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be Divine Revelations.</p>

                        <hi>Rev. 2.10.</hi>
                     </bibl> Fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer, behold the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that you may be tryed, and you ſhall have tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ten daies: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WHence obſerve, 1. <hi>The people of God muſt ſuffer.</hi> Through tribulation, through many tribulations they muſt enter into the Kingdome of God: From a croſs into Heaven: think it not ſtrange, no not of the fiery tryal, thou ſhalt ſuffer. 2. What
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109191:158"/>ever ſufferings the people of God either are, or may be in, they have no juſt cauſe, ground, or reaſon of fear, <hi>i. e.</hi> of diſponding, diſtruſting, diſtracting fear. The Arguments for this point are in the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Conſideration of who it is, that brings the People of God into ſuffering, Is it <hi>God?</hi> God is the Diſpoſer, but who is the great Executioner? The Devil, whom God hates more than thou canſt, The Devil ſhall caſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis the <hi>Devil</hi> in a Chain. The Devil hath two ſorts of Chains. A Chain of darkneſs, in which he is kept to the day of Judgement. A Chain of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he is reſtrained in that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Quality</hi> of the ſuffering ſhould keep them from fearing: He <hi>ſhall caſt ſome of you into Priſon,</hi> not into Hell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Deſign,</hi> to deſtroy you? no, but to <hi>try you:</hi> 'Tis well you are Gold, elſe you would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently deſtroyed and burnt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Duration,</hi> could the Devil have his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, it ſhould be for ever: 'Tis but for <hi>ten daies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. God over-rules all that befalls us, Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtands by the Beleever to take notice of every ſtripe, as well as of every hair of thy head, to own thee in all thy ſufferings, to ſympathize with thee, to have a fellow-feeling and compaſſion unto thee, to compoſe us, and ſanctifie all unto us, to order the iſſue of all, that it ſhall be ſure, ſpeedy, and good, and by all theſe to make us as like God, God-man, as poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Then do not fear: Here we were forewarned and fore-Armed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Forewarned,</hi> our ſuffering is like to be great, nay, it may be greater then we may ſuppoſe: This to bee ſure, if our <hi>ſufferings</hi> do but keep pace with our <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:109191:159"/>I beleeve never ſuch <hi>ſufferings</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> If God lay Righteouſneſs to the Line, and Judgement to the Plummet, never ſuch matter for his Juſtice in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhould not fear becauſe that is the ſpring of many other ſins, Fainting, Running, Lying, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and to do any thing in the world <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The beſt of men in ſuch bad times, it will bee as much as ever they can doe to keep themſelves ſteady.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We were <hi>Fore-armed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In reference to the <hi>Church</hi> of God: Do not fear, the Church of God is dear to thee, but 'tis dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to God. The Intereſt of God is more concerned in the life, peace, and truth of the Church, then in mine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the great God will not look to his own Intereſt, can the Church be ſafe? But doubtleſs hee will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reference to <hi>our ſelves.</hi> Suppoſe many ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, yet the waies of God are in the <hi>dark,</hi> as well as in the <hi>deep,</hi> there's no tracing of him, let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, where thou canſt not trace him, admire him. God can, and hath done, and I bleſs God, I can ſet my Seal to that word that tells mee, God will do great things; <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt ſink, his people muſt bee called, the Kings of the earth muſt hate that <hi>Whore,</hi> when God brings his people low, 'tis but making way for the bareing and magnifying his own mercy; when the praiſe can be given to none, now is a time for God to work. <hi>Now will I ariſe and ſhew my ſelf ſtrong.</hi> Therefore <hi>fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer:</hi> Fear not oh! ye <hi>Saints</hi> of the moſt high: Tis true, if you were carnal, natural, unconverted, ſinful, Idolatrous wretches, well might you fear the wrath of the Lamb, and him that ſitteth on the

                        <hi>Acts 24.25.</hi>
                     </bibl> And as he reaſoned of Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judgement to come, <hi>Faelix</hi> trembled.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN theſe words you have the manner, matter, and effect of <hi>Paul's</hi> Preaching; The <hi>manner,</hi> why <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>reaſoning;</hi> The matter 'tis of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Temperance and Judgement to come; the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Faelix</hi> trembled. Firſt, for the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Pauls</hi> Preaching, as <hi>he reaſoned, i. e.</hi> as he argued the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he did propound it in a rational way, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued it before <hi>Faelix,</hi> and this he doth in a double capacity, as he is a <hi>Convert,</hi> and as he is an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as a <hi>Christian,</hi> and as a <hi>Preacher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As a <hi>Convert</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and ſo he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to do, and make uſe of that reaſon he had to ſhew, though he became Righteous, yet <hi>Paul</hi> had not loſt his reaſon. Hence learn, true Religion will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with right Reaſon. Bleſſed be God for this Truth; We are apt to look upon men as mad men, if they will be Righteous: 'Tis true, before <hi>Paul</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, he had <hi>Reaſon</hi> but he uſed it madly, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Converſion he begins to be ſober, and make the beſt uſe of his Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look upon <hi>Paul</hi> as a <hi>Preacher,</hi> ſo he makes uſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109191:160"/>of his Reaſon. And True Reaſon may and muſt bee uſed in Preaching the Goſpel, yet with theſe two Cautions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do not over-value Reaſon; do not lift up the Servant above the Maſter: Prize <hi>Grace</hi> more then <hi>Reaſon; Piety</hi> is better then <hi>Parts,</hi> though <hi>Parts</hi> are the <hi>Ring</hi> of Gold, <hi>Piety</hi> is the <hi>Diamond</hi> in that Ring. As if, a man in a Pulpit ſhould come to ſhew what a brave Scholler he is, this is to over-value Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not under-value Reaſon. We have had a ſtrange fancy, that if a man that could not read Engliſh would but come and talke and preach to us, he was far more deſirable then a <hi>Black-Coat</hi> that hath been at <hi>Univerſity</hi> and learnt his root there (as they ſay) you will be glad of ſuch as theſe. This Learning hath ſpoiled all the world, do you not know how many Schollers are Atheiſts; and their learning made them the worſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is not the fault of their Reaſon; had they more Reaſon they would improve it better. It is want of Reaſon that makes them not Crucifie their Luſts: Becauſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt men many times reprove that which is good, will you therefore caſt it off.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Pauls</hi> Preaching, and here obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis ſuitable to his hearers, <hi>Faelix</hi> was a Judge though a corrupt one, and ſo he reaſons of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe:</hi> He and his Whore lived in <hi>Adultery,</hi> and ſo he preaches of <hi>Temperance,</hi> of <hi>Judgement</hi> to come, know, God will call thee to judgement. Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. The Goſpel <hi>is then preached aright, when ſuted to hearers hearts, conditions, conſtitutions:</hi> A man in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> ought not to ſhoot at random, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>ad rem</hi> to his hearers, ſuitably tells them of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109191:160"/>Temperance, Judgement to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider it with Relation to his <hi>Scope,</hi> which was, to bring them unto Chriſt, and what doth hee do? He Preaches Grace, Mercy, and Peace, no, not a word of that, but <hi>Righteouſneſs, Temperance, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come. Paul</hi> was a convincing Preacher, hee knows his way to bring home <hi>Faelix</hi> and <hi>Druſilla,</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was firſt to convince them of their ſin, and the wrath of God due to ſin. The whole ſumme of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching is, a preaching by way of conviction: Sin and miſery muſt be preached for this end, that it may bring men unto Chriſt; wee muſt not make men half dead and there leave them, but bring them to the Chirurgion, all our conviction is only for this end, that you might be brought to Chriſt, by Grace, to Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching: <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and <hi>Faelix</hi> trembled: doth not <hi>Druſylla</hi> tremble? 'Tis more then probable, ſhee brought <hi>Paul</hi> to preach there, that <hi>Druſylla</hi> had a months mind to hear what he had to ſay, but <hi>Faelix</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; Hence obſerve, <hi>Thoſe that are firſt in enjoying, may be laſt in receiving the Goſpel. Druſylla</hi> was a —yet turns a wicked <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> yet when come to hear a Sermon, her Heatheniſh Husband <hi>Faelix</hi> that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Devil inſtead of God trembled, but not ſhe; Back-ſliding Profeſſors from the Truth, are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly farther from melting under the Goſpel, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſinners, that never heard of it. A man had far better go and preach to <hi>Heathens,</hi> then <hi>Apoſtates.</hi> Then for the words, <hi>Faelix Trembled.</hi> Why? There was <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> proſecuted and convinced, <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> threatned againſt him; Now his knees begin to ſmite together, now the Writing on the Wall, now <hi>Faelix trembles;</hi> Oh! poor ſoul, wouldſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109191:161"/>thou not tremble at the hearing of the Preaching of Judgement to come? ſubmit to the Judge before he come: wouldſt thou not have thy Judge to condemn thee then? Let him be now thy King to Rule, thy Prophet to inſtruct, thy Prieſt to reconcile: Would you avoid the terrour of a Judgement to come? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the offer of a Chriſt coming; coming did I ſay?

               <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> was, <hi>When Chriſt knocks and calls, at the doors of our hearts, 'tis our Duty and Intereſt, to open, admit, and let him in.</hi> Theſe two queſtions were propoſed and proſecuted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When or now, is Chriſt ſaid to knock and call at the hearts of ſinners?</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How is Chriſt ſaid to knock and call at the hearts of ſinners?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:109191:162"/>
               <p n="1">1. If you regard the <hi>means</hi> whereby hee knocks, <hi>i. e.</hi> by natural light of conſcience within, or by the light of the Miniſtry and Goſpel without.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you regard the <hi>manner</hi> of Chriſts knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or calling, 'tis either externally, by the Word, Ordinances, Providences (his Rod hath a voice as well as his Word) or internally, by the Spirit of God that accompanies that Word, by the means of Grace, by the motions of his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How are ſinners ſaid to hear his voice, and open?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For hearing, it muſt not be an external, but an internal hearing, a hearing of the heart, through the heart; it muſt be a particular, diſtinguiſhing hearing, it muſt know the voice of Chriſt; it muſt be a ſenſible, an humble, ſatisfying hearing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>opening;</hi> it is either</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Progreſſive, i. e.</hi> when the ſoul opens more and more: for there's no door, but its ſhut as cloſe on him when after entrance, that 'tis as much as ever Chriſt can do to creep in. This opening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In parting with, and putting away what ever keeps poſſeſſion of the heart againſt Chriſt: The ſtrong man muſt be turned out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſoul freely conſents to Chriſt, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire reſignation to his Will and Spirit, to take him upon thoſe tearms. And when Chriſt doth thus <hi>knock</hi> and call at the door of our hearts, 'tis our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and intereſt thus to open admittance to him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> was for <hi>Exhortation,</hi> to plead with poor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109191:162"/>ſinners, that yet, oh! yet they would <hi>open</hi> to Chriſt Jeſus <hi>knocking</hi> and calling: Arguments here there was uſed, if they did not melt, 'twas not becauſe they were not <hi>powerful,</hi> but our ſouls marble.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis a matter of greateſt importance, more than your earthly Joyntures, it concerns your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſouls, ſouls that are more worth than ten thouſand worlds; whether you will now beleeve it or no, you will hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the perſon that comes to call; who is it? 'Tis a King that ſtands at your door; 'tis the King of Kings, God of Gods, that ſtands there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis hee that deſerves admittance, a God of abundant, ſuperabundant love; by his undertaking hee hath deſerved admittance: will you keep out your Father? your Mother? thou wretch, that waſt reſcued the other day, wilt thou keep out thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer?</p>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. I have ſtood a long time, I have been ſtaying and waiting for you ſo many years; I can reckon every day and night I have ſtood and waited for you: you would have abhorr'd to have waited on the greateſt man in the world, as I have waited on you, a worm; nay, I ſtay ſtill waiting for you;</p>
               <p>And This one thing ſticks yet with mee; I ſtand ready to depart; I have knocked a great while, but now knock no more; what if this ſhould be the laſt <hi>knock</hi> you ſhould hear? How many did knock, and the laſt knock'd, yet <hi>I ſtand;</hi> I knock this once
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109191:163"/>more; 'tis very queſtionable whether Chriſt will ever knock again, at leaſt in ſuch a way, and by ſuch means; never did Chriſt knock more louder.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I ſtand at the <hi>door,</hi> a poor cold place: I ſtand deſpiſed and contemned: but beſides, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the mean time are let in, and I kept out, and that out of my own houſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I ſtand at the door, ready to have my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience turned into fury; therefore, let mee come in quickly.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I ſtand, I that am bleſſed in my ſelf, I that can make thee infinitely, eternally bleſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I that am, &amp;c, do ſtand, therefore prethee, prethee <hi>open.</hi> What's that? 'Tis hear and know, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, beleeve and do. And this would give mee a fair Retreat into my <hi>Text; If you know theſe things, happy are yee if yee do them.</hi> I beſeech you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, you have known theſe things, curſed, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever are yee, if yee do not do them, happy for ever if you do them.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a ſhort account of theſe things lately delivered to you: you muſt not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute any of my weakneſſes to my Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns labours that went before; the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bleſs you, and reward them a thouſand-fold. And, oh! what ever God doth, keep up <hi>this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> in the midſt of us. You have abundantly reaped Gods Spirit; I hope there is ſomething done in this Congregation, that Eternity it ſelf ſhall never bee able to blot out. I confeſs this is no <hi>faſting day,</hi> but yet however wee may make it ſuch a day, as, ſince God is pleaſed to give us an <hi>Ocean,</hi> to return to him ſome <hi>drops.</hi> Beloved, 'Tis very probable that it will bee the laſt motion that ever I ſhall make to you while I live in this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109191:163"/>way; If I were now to go from my Pulpit to my grave, this would bee the double motion I would make to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Gods ſake prize the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Labour to prize the Word of God by the worth of it, that you may never come to prize the Word of God by the want of it. And if you would expreſs your prizing of the Word, expreſs your love, charity, bowels, to poor Miniſters of the Word: never any man repented hee had given ſo much to a good uſe, doubtleſs my children wants it now, or my wife wants it now, &amp;c. And I can aſſure you, I think there was never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thankſgivings made to God for this <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as for their abundant charity in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
